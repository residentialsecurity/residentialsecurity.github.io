<p>The Mi Home Security Camera Basic 1080p does not store any data on the cloud (unlike Yi, which gives you a 30-day free cloud storage for your video feeds and you can opt for different plans to get more storage) Having a cloud storage is a better option as you are assured that your video feeds are not corrupted in the micro SD card or not lost if the camera itself is stolen or damaged.</p>
<p>The company is fairly new to the security camera market having released its SimpliCam in mid-2017. They come with multiple ports and are great for powering close-together cameras or cameras that aren't near an outlet, like attic cameras.

Value Series Card Terminals are stand-alone access control devices featuring a lightweight and advanced design; they offer access control that requires swiping an ID card or entering a password.</p>

From helping to deter burglars to automating your business, ADT offers a range of advanced security technology, with solutions built to meet your needs.</p>
