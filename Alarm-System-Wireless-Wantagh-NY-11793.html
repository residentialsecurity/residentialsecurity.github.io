<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately. Usually, they are black and white cameras that do not have very high resolution. Real-time alarm notifications, sirens, video recording, and easy viewing make it one of the best home security systems in the Indian market.</p>
