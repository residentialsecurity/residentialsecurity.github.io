Some home security providers offer both DIY and professional installation, while others only provide one option. Brinks equipment options include basic home security or home security with video, and the alarm panel is also a smart home hub compatible with Z-wave and Alexa devices.</p>

Security systems have recently adopted cellular technology, making them easier than ever to install without professional help.</p>
