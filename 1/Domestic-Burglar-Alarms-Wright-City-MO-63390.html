<p>It offers many of the same features that high-end security cameras have for less, and it was the easiest to use and set up of all the home security cameras we tested. Properly located video surveillance cameras can extend the range of the security staff and provide valuable incident information. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.</p>
<p>However, if entry to the vehicle is authorized and the engine is started within the 15 second or 30 second time interval as selected by switch 88, then charge comparator 42 is switched to provide a positive logic output, which resets arming timer 50 and flip-flop 72. If the output of flip-flop 72 drops to a zero logic level before timeout of entry delay timer 86, then no output pulse is provided by timer 86 and no alarm is sounded.</p>
