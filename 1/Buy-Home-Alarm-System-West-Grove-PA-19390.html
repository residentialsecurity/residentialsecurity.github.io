<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. IP camera: An Internet Protocol camera generally transmits a digital signal using Internet Protocol over a network. Home security system installation costs depend on your method of installation — professional installation costs $100 to $500 or more, while DIY security systems are free to install yourself. The video surveillance market is highly competitive, owing to strong presence of the existing vendors.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>
