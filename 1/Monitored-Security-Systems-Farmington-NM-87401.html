Surveillance Cameras: Available in both wired and wireless configurations, surveillance cameras can be used in several different ways as part of an overall security system.</p>
<p>If you have your security system professionally installed, you will need to be able to take time off work or arrange for someone to be at your home while the system is being installed which could take a few hours or more.

<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at.

<p>Monitoring is provided by Brinks Home Security but doesn't include fire service with the Nest Protect. The worth of the camera depends on the quality of images it captures in low lighting conditions. Multiple viewers can use the app at the same time. Since your equipment comes preprogrammed, you can pair it with the hub and control it through one app. Professional installation services may cost up to $250, although special offers that waive installation fees are common.</p>
