<h2>New Home Security Systems Adel Georgia</h2>
<p>Some security cameras have very high quality images, so you don't have to stare at fuzzy pictures you can't make out. Based around the Hub, you get a Multi Sensor, for doors and windows, a Motion Sensor, Presence Sensor that lets you know people arrive or leave home and a Power Outlet plug that controls anything plugged into it. The second connection is a sense input along line 28 to the negative terminal of the battery to pick up the voltage drop across battery cable 24. Finally, a power lead 30 serves to connect the circuitry to the positive battery terminal 12 so that the circuitry will have operating power.</p>

<p>In place of the source of illumination 87 and cell 88 or in combination therewith and the other devices, we may employ a bulb or source of light 92 in combinatlon with alight-sensitive cell 94 connected through a battery 89 with an amplifier vacuum tube 95. From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>
