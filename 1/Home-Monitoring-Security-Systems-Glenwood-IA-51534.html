<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app ‘EZVIZ' by the house owners. Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>
<p>We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. If you're concerned about privacy and would rather not store your video in the cloud, look for a camera equipped with a microSD card slot so you can store it locally. And Nest's monitoring plans start at $10 per month for a limited basic plan. If there is any movement in front of the house, the camera will record pictures and videos and send the same to the control room and the owner's phone.Those residents wanting more details of this app are requested to speak to the designated police officials in their respective police station limits.</p>
