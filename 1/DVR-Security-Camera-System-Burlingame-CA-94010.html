<p>Panasonic, leading the global security industry for 60 years, will continue to provide world-top-class innovative intelligent AI security solutions supported by Panasonic unique video capturing x sensing” technology for a safer tomorrow. As previously mentioned, CCTV DVRs have a multiplexer built in which enables the user to view multiple images on the screen at any given time by segregating the screen image. The result is the broadest security infrastructure portfolio available from any single vendor, from high-performance NVRs, to hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), to the largest shared storage and archive solutions, to analytics processing.</p>
<p>With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly fees if you decide to self-monitor.

Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>
<p>There's widespread concern that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. It's always wiser to invest in a good quality, small, entry level system that allows you to add more cameras later on, than to rush out and buy an unbranded cheap camera, that could lead to buyer's remorse.
