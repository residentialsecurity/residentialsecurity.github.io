<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Huawei HoloSens Intelligent Video & Data Analytics — built on Huawei's cutting-edge AI technologies and accumulated expertise in big data, the cloud, and 5G — revolutionizes the video surveillance industry, transforming it from a model of simple video collection, to one of 360° data awareness, moving from basic perception toward smart foresight and intelligent prediction.</p>
<p>It is natural that Godrej is a market leader in the manufacture of CCTV surveillance systems. While previously Nest offered plans with different recording and storage options, Nest is now part of the Google Nest smart home services, with each Nest device available to buy separately.
