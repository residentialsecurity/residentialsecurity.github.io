In most cases, they are used for a dual purpose: for real-time monitoring of physical assets and spaces and to review of collected video information towards identifying security indicators and planning security measures. This rising demand in various verticals across the globe is expected to create increased growth opportunity for the global CCTV camera market.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department.

Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>At the cheaper end of the smart security camera market, I wasn't expecting big things from the BT Smart Camera.
