<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Nowadays, with advanced technology, you have high-quality network IP cameras available at reasonable prices. When your alarm goes off, two indicators within the house, such as a door contact and a motion sensor, must both have been triggered to warrant police call-out. Matrix brings you centralized security with IP Video Surveillance solutions that can manage multiple devices located at multiple locations.</p>
<p>There's no longer a need to sign up for expensive professional monitoring contracts—most of these systems offer free DIY monitoring as well as optional contract-free professional monitoring subscription plans that start as low as a few dollars a month. There are cameras with built-in VMD to alert security guards and improve their ability to detect and locate personnel and be alerted to activity in the scene.</p>
