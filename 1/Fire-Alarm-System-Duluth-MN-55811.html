<p>Wireless DIY home alarms are generally less expensive than systems that require a professional technician to install, but many homeowners feel safer with a wired system.

These types of cameras typically use rechargeable batteries that can be easily popped out and taken indoors for charging with a USB cable, but they tend to drain quickly in colder weather.
