Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>

Nest uses the same home alarm monitoring centers as Brinks, but the service comes with a lower monthly cost.</p>
