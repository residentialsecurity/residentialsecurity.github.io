SimpliSafe has earned this spot with easy DIY setup, fast response times, and an impressive lineup of home automation features. With Vivint wireless security camera systems, there are no wires to alert intruders that they are being monitored, and the network signal will still transmit even if the power goes out. The associated technology is transitioning from standalone and analog video to networked (IP) and digital video.</p>
<p>Vivint makes cutting-edge security cameras for indoor and outdoor use. It is common for companies to charge a separate fee for monitoring services. Most of today's home security systems will offer some degree of smart home integration and it's a worthwhile add-on or enhancement for more complete control of many working parts of the home.
