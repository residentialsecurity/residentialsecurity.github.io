IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
<p>These cameras do not require a video capture card because they work using a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer.
