<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Homeowners can choose from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can record footage when an alarm is triggered, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, nanny cameras, and more. Monitoring fees begin at $29, and equipment costs range from $299 to $499. Whether you need a widespread system that can cover multiple locations or just a few cameras to watch your storefront, there's a solution for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to add extras like cameras or security lighting, the up-front equipment price gets a lot steeperâ€”but there's no company that can beat Ring's $10 a month monitoring fee. Explosion proof cameras can protect your employees from any disaster or accident beforehand, and also provide real-time support. As a bonus, most insurers provide reduced rates when home monitoring systems are installed.</p>
