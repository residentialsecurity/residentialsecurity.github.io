<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
<p>Visible security cameras are effective burglary deterrents, but they are also targets for theft and vandalism. A wide range of products are available in Security & Surveillance Cameras section to offer the best to you. IP cameras also have additional features that analog cameras don't offer, such as video analytics, which allow for mobile notifications and automatic recording if there is movement within the camera's field of vision.</p>

<p>Network video recorder (NVR) supports IP cameras only, however, to support analog cameras it requires an encoder. Our CCTV Security Pros "Blue Line" IP Series has been used in tens of thousands of professional installations since 2012. It also sends mobile security alerts, and it works as a control panel for connected smarthome devices. Some home security companies sell alarms and equipment individually, and others offer packages of bundled devices.</p>
<p>Smart home automation technology is increasingly popular in security systems. In today's market, there are three main types of security system packages available: home automation, security equipment, and environmental monitoring. The use of sophisticated systems by police and other public security officials is particularly troubling in a democratic society. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording.</p>
<p>There's widespread concern that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. It's always wiser to invest in a good quality, small, entry level system that allows you to add more cameras later on, than to rush out and buy an unbranded cheap camera, that could lead to buyer's remorse. Using the garage door controller, manage your garage using the Vivint Smart Home app and receive notifications if your garage door is open or if it failed to close.</p>
