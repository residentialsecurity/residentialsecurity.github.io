<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will automatically alert the control panel, setting off the alarm. These sensors detect infrared energy, enabling them to detect dramatic increases of heat in a room - such as would occur when a burglar enters an otherwise empty room.</p>

But Nest Aware is now a far more appealing proposition for those looking to kit their homes out with multiple security cameras.</p>
<p>While digital video surveillance systems offer an exceeding amount of rich features compared to their analogue ancestors, they still require thoughtful design and deployment to ensure maximum cost-effectiveness.
