<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? The indoor video camera comes with full 1080p HD video recording as well as two-way audio. It's the ideal choice for a security guard to monitor live video feed on site. A fully programmable environmental monitoring system, the Sensaphone 800 allows both local and remote monitoring and control of your home or small business. These are the premium packages you see that cost upwards of $350-$700 for the equipment and around $40-$60 per month for monitoring.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>

Unmonitored home security systems use most of the same equipment as monitored systems.</p>

<p>Surveillance plays a huge part in today's society, and with cameras all around us, our day-to-day lives are experiencing higher levels of security each day. Outdoor video cameras play a very important role in law enforcement by not only capturing video of potential criminals but also by preventing crimes. They'll also send an alert to your phone when someone or something is out there, record video of the event, and depending on features, let you talk to whoever is on your property, all without ever having to open your door (or even be inside your house, for that matter).</p>
<p>Multiple cameras work together to provide a security mesh which can easily be tracked from a single command center. The heart of these home security devices is a control panel, operated with keypads located at key points throughout your house. The ADT video doorbell security camera lets you see if visitors at your door are welcome ones. From a simple doorbell camera through to a whole-house system requiring professional installation, there's something for all tastes and budgets when it comes to smart home security.</p>
