<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
