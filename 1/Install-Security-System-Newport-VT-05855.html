<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. But just like Netgear, they've also ventured into digital home solutions, specifically remote home monitoring systems. An alert's processing time, or response time,” can depend on the system setup, monitoring center technology, staff training, and other factors.

In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
