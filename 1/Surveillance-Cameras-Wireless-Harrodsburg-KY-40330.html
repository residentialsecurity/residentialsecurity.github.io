The majority of security systems come with wireless sensors that can be placed in strategic locations around your home, like on doors or windows and in living rooms and bedrooms. Once all connected together, if someone opens a window or door, or walks past a sensor, you will receive an alert on your phone.

<h2>Home Security Packages Harrodsburg Kentucky</h2>
<p>For Prince Georges, Maryland Customers: If we disconnect your service(s) or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the pre-payment, we shall within thirty (30) days or your next billing cycle, whichever is earlier, return a sum equal to the pre-payments(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the service(s) or for any equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Most Sensaphone devices offer real-time status reports, so you can check on the house while you're away. Wireless home security systems are great for renters and homeowners alike since the sensors are easily removable - you can take them with you to a new home or apartment if you move or relocate, for example.
