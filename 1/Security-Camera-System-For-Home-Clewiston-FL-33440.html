<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras.

<p>In late 1990s, the digital cameras came into the market, they were built on Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) based image sensor whose performance is better and are cheaper than Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD).

<p>Customizable security features: Consumers can choose the plan with the features they want, from basic monitoring, two-way voice communication, home automation, video monitoring and more.
