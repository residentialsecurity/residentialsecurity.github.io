<p>Our security systems start with a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) or Network Video Recorder (NVR) that include security grade hard drives that can store days, weeks, or even months of security footage. While some home video surveillance systems allow for custom installation by the user, some require professional installation which may or may not make them less attractive.</p>

Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>

<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

These smart digital cameras can spot motion, detect objects, read vehicle number plates, and even identify human behaviors. Sound the siren on your Ring Alarm from anywhere inside your home and dispatch emergency services with professional monitoring.</p>
