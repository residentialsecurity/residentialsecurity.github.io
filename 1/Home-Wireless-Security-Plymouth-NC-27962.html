<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? An edge-based analytic, it runs on Axis network cameras to minimize server-side storage, CPU, and network requirements. Security is crucial in a crisis, but smart home equipment comes in handy every single day. When you're thinking about alarm systems, you might instantly start wondering whether to go for a DIY set-up or to call in the professionals.
