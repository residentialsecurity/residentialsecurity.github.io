<p>One policeman, making sure to cover his face, approaches the CCTV camera and breaks it. There are three types of CCTV surveillance cameras on the market, from the most affordable entry level analogue cameras to High Definition (HD) and Internet Protocol (IP) cameras at the top end of the market.

<p>A basic application of this is the monitoring of passenger traffic jetway—if persons exiting an aircraft reverse course, the camera monitoring that jetway will see the change in course and the object tracking software can decide” to notify an operator in the Security Operations Center.

<p>The Smart Home Video Monitoring plan adds intelligent assistance for complete home monitoring with smart video cameras. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras.

<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
<p>There are two main types of connections for CCTV cameras: a fixed cable or a wireless connection. Video surveillance (CCTV, body cameras, aerial surveillance) systems create a number of unique storage challenges. Currently, no DIY home security systems work with HomeKit, but if you're a Google Home owner, you may prefer to choose one of our other picks.
