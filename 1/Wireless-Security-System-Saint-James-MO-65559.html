<p>From basic safety protection to smart businesses and lives: Following a clear vision — "AI + platform + openness" — Huawei has built an algorithm and application store based on Ascend and Kunpeng chips, developed a multi-algorithm concurrency framework (which supports the concurrent operation of diverse algorithms from different vendors), and established Huawei OpenLabs across the globe, promoting cooperation with local partners, all with the aim of fostering and enriching an intelligent ecosystem.</p>
<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>Many ADT installation packages roll together equipment fees with professional installation. Most wireless systems include Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that work with a smartphone app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage. While wireless home security systems are popular and known for an easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more reliable because they aren't subject to interference.</p>
<p>In one, New York City police in a helicopter supposedly monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared video camera on an amorous couple enjoying the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop balcony. Step 2. Connect the security camera to the network.

Just enter the address of the property you want to monitor — it's that easy.</p>
<p>If you don't plan on staying in your home for an extended amount of time, you might want to consider a DIY wireless security system so you can easily take it with you when you move unless you are willing to pay to have a wired system moved and reinstalled at your new location. With Security packages, certified professionals monitor your home for alarms, smoke, carbon monoxide or water leaks to notify you and emergency services as needed.</p>
