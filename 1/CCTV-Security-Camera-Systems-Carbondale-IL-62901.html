<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. The majority of security systems come with wireless sensors that can be placed in strategic locations around your home, like on doors or windows and in living rooms and bedrooms. Once all connected together, if someone opens a window or door, or walks past a sensor, you will receive an alert on your phone. Pacific Controls offers an innovative, reliable and secure solution - Video Surveillance as a Service to meet the objective of implementing video surveillance solution for inland security.</p>
<p>Protect your homes and offices with security systems by Eurovigil, a brand by Eureka Forbes that has come a long way in giving its customers the most advanced technology in intruder alarms. That said, it does deliver solid, basic home security that will detect motion, sense if a door or window is opened, and sound an alarm. The SAT130 has an FTP Proxy which can allow IP cameras to transfer images over the satellite link.</p>
