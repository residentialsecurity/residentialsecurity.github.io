Cameras and doorbells are also easy to install, but you'll have to pair them yourself.

A VIP system consists of a video camera (a digitiser in the case of analogue cameras) and a microprocessor for processing the digital-image - and software to interpret the image content and extract detection information from it.</p>
<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use. But this alarm company delivers more in a basic package (like smoke and carbon monoxide monitoring) than many other home security companies, which explains why you'll find higher entry-level prices.</p>
