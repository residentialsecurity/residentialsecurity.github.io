<p>Many cheap security systems have extra features too. Monitoring services are performed by a third party monitoring service with an 30-second average response time. Sensors can detect intruders by a variety of methods, such as monitoring doors and windows for opening, or by monitoring unoccupied interiors for motions, sound, vibration, or other disturbances.</p>
<p>If you add monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. Many security companies outsource their monitoring to a 3rd party dispatch. Frontpoint offers five plans , all of which include professional monitoring for $35-$40 per month. To research the best security system for your needs, consider whether you require video monitoring, you want voice recognition features, and how technically savvy you are about managing your system.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set amount of time, typically one to five years. To help you with this important decision, we'll run through all the key features of a home security system, discuss some important choices homeowners must make, and review the major companies offering systems, while first providing some of the main reasons your home may be at risk.</p>

Perhaps even more disturbing is the idea of some stranger monitoring video from your indoor and outdoor security cameras. Customized equipment packages come with anywhere between 3 to 12 devices including base stations and keypads, entry sensors, motion sensors, and sirens.</p>
