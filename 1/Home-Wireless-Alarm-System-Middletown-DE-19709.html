<p>Modern CCTV cameras are also getting smaller and less obtrusive, while at the same time promising better clarity, night-time infrared support, and lesser maintenance costs.

The top rated and most affordable options include security systems from Ring, Abode, SimpliSafe and iSmartAlarm.</p>
<p>If you have an ADT security system with Pulse or Control service, Alexa can also arm your system when you set Guard to Away mode, and you can opt to forward Smart Alerts to your security provider. With cheaper production techniques, surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems, and for everyday surveillance. For small business owners , we recommend ADT , Vivint , SimpliSafe , and Abode With each of these providers, you'll have access to video surveillance, smart devices, and remote management by mobile app for convenient control.</p>

<p>SimpliSafe's contact sensors for doors and windows are small enough to be camouflaged when installed on white trim; the motion sensor is noticeable, but not an eyesore. Perhaps even more disturbing is the idea of some stranger monitoring video from your indoor and outdoor security cameras.
