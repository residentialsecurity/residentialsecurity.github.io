This CCTV camera is capable of capturing images with absolute clarity at FHD 1080p. Whether you go with DIY or pro monitoring, you'll be able to set up these options yourself, since most are wireless without the need for permanent installation. In 2019, the situation has changed: home security systems have grown both more technologically sophisticated and user friendly, increasing their accuracy and reducing the risk of false alarms.</p>
