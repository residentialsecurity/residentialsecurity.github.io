<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

<p>At the same time, since the employer-employee relationship is built on trust, always ensure you do not go overboard with your CCTV placements.

E-Series can act as back-end storage for digital or network video recorders or can plug into large-scale IP camera networks using IP SAN technologies.</p>

As per the framework for Nirbhaya Fund , setup in the aftermath of the Delhi incident, CCTV should not only be used for recording events or incidents but there should be real-time monitoring of the footage and quick response.</p>
