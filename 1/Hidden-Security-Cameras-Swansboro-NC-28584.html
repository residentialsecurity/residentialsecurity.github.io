<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do.

<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move.
