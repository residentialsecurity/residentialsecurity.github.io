<h3>5 Reasons To Install A Video Security Camera System At Your Home in Marathon</h3>
<p>ADT Pulse app: Through the ADT Pulse app, you can arm or disarm your home security system, monitor for your home for break-ins and disasters and receive text alerts and email notifications. Common uses of video surveillance include observing the public at the entry to sports events, public transportation (train platforms, airports, etc.), and around the perimeter of secure facilities, especially those that are directly bounded by community spaces.</p>
<p>All the devices that connect with the internet at some point, can be used by hackers to spy on you or take control of smart home functionality, for instance, or can be the target of botnets, AI powered malware and crypto hijacking. Multiple Users viewing: Multiple users could watch the live video from the same camera at the same time, clearly and smoothly.</p>
<p>With a special feature of motion capture, any movement in front of the camera would be detected and the footage along with photos sent both to the house owners and also to the police, following which the police patrol teams would be directed to the house. And some cameras have special features that go beyond those basics.

If the output of flip-flop 72 drops to a zero logic level before timeout of entry delay timer 86, then no output pulse is provided by timer 86 and no alarm is sounded.</p>
