<p>Wireless home security system: Wireless home alarm systems utilize a series of battery-powered sensors to alert homeowners of potential intrusions. If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address.

Nearly all no monthly fee home security systems provide apps as a way for consumers to connect with their device on the go. This includes apps to turn on and off the system in some cases.</p>
