<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Our door and window alarms help detect break-ins, and our optional glass break sensors are prepared for all situations; if intruders bypass the usual sensors by breaking the glass as opposed to picking the locks, the glass break sensors will sound an alarm.</p>
<p>The Wired Auto dialer is connected with wires to the main control unit whereas the Wireless Auto dialer does not use wired to connect to the Control unit. This expression allows one to determine the minimum number of megapixel cameras required to cover a given scene at the specified camera resolution.
