With our CCTV cameras, you will now be able to detect any changes in behaviour, however insignificant. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>

<p>Having a reliable burglar alarm system for your jewelry business means that line supervision and line security must be an operational component for complete protection.
