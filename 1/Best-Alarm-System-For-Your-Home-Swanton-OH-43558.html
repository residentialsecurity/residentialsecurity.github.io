<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Though these surveillance cameras have relatively discrete appearance, it still has a great effect in deterring criminals. Most frequently it is used in video surveillance systems and can provide a storage of 2 TB to 4 TB. The system is also subject to false alarms resulting from automobile headlights, lightning flashes and so forth, entering the receiver. Our local reseller offers several levels of service, each of which offers different features, but with a similar up-front cost of about $300.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike.

<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensors. Simply go to one of the video surveillance storage matrix tables to select the table row that lists the frame resolution and fps needed for each 24×7 video stream, then read across to find the nearest desired archival period (shown in days) and the corresponding drive capacity required for each individual stream.</p>
