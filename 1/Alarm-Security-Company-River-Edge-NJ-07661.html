<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. SimpliSafe has earned this spot with easy DIY setup, fast response times, and an impressive lineup of home automation features. With Vivint wireless security camera systems, there are no wires to alert intruders that they are being monitored, and the network signal will still transmit even if the power goes out. The associated technology is transitioning from standalone and analog video to networked (IP) and digital video.</p>

<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>

<p>To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will automatically alert the control panel, setting off the alarm. These sensors detect infrared energy, enabling them to detect dramatic increases of heat in a room - such as would occur when a burglar enters an otherwise empty room.</p>
<p>These cameras do not require a video capture card because they work using a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer. Qumulo's file system delivers fast, affordable storage for video surveillance that scales easily with built-in data protection and real-time analytics.

<p>A boom in wireless security cameras is inspiring a movement in DIY home surveillance. We like the Smart Home Video monitoring plan because it includes security cameras and video monitoring. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>
