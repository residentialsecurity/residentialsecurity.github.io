<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>In particular, CCTV allows greater flexibility in the deployment of security personnel by providing the facility whereby a single observer can remotely monitor several areas from one location. Under the project, the ACST would hire the services of BSNL, which will install 300 CCTV cameras at over 100 important locations across the city, including the entry-exit points, malls, sensitive areas, railway stations, bus stops and airports.</p>
<p>There are two main types of connections for CCTV cameras: a fixed cable or a wireless connection. Video surveillance (CCTV, body cameras, aerial surveillance) systems create a number of unique storage challenges.
