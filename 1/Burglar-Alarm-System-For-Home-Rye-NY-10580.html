<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Companies can add detectors and sensors for fire, smoke, flood, carbon monoxide and even freezing pipes onto your monthly monitoring service for increased protection. The Ultra Series Fingerprint Terminals provide the large fingerprints and cards capacities and comprehensive access control functions for large projects. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensors in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.</p>
<p>The ownership of the CCTV cameras and broadband network will remain with the BSNL.

<p>The company, which offers the simple SimpliCam, wins our first PCMag Readers' Choice Award for home security cameras.
