<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. North America maintains its supremacy in global CCTV camera market, Latin America to offer new revenue lines. Software is used on the local PC that allows access to the digital video recorder. More high-end equipment packages—like the ones Vivint Smart Home provides—come with a touch-screen control panel and the option to add outdoor home security cameras, all of which require professional installation.</p>

Some home security companies sell alarms and equipment individually, and others offer packages of bundled devices.</p>
