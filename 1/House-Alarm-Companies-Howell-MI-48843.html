<p>These growing surveillance requirements are in-turn, driving demand to broadly deploy digital video surveillance systems with capabilities that include panoramic, high-definition IP-based cameras, Digital and Network Video Recorders, video management software, indexing applications, facial recognition technology, big data analysis and the storage media to capture and retain it all for as much as 365 days.</p>
<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at.
