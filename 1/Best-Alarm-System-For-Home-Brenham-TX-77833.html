<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? They sell high-decibel alarm systems that are compatible with video cameras, environmental monitoring, home automation and voice control. Our security specialists can provide and install monitored, wireless, or remote alarm systems for houses and businesses across the South East region. Some small retailers selling unbranded cameras may only offer a statutory six month product guarantee at best, which you might find yourself fighting for, if the camera fails within that time frame.</p>
