Link up individual analog cameras from LaView, Ezviz, and Night Owl Security Products or get a pre-built surveillance system kit.</p>
<p>All Blue by ADT equipment and services are compatible with LifeShield systems. Some DIY systems are self-monitored, which means you'll receive alerts when devices are triggered, but it's up to you to contact the local authorities if there's a break-in or a fire.
