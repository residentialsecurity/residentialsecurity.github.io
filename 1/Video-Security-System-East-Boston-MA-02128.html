Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. There are plenty of affordable cameras available that offer good video performance, but as with just about any smart device, you'll pay more for features such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connectivity, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage options, and rechargeable battery power.</p>
