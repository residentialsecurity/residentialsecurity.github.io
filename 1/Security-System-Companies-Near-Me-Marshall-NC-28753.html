<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The main difference between the two is that the Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera has a more robust design and is built to be weatherproof, rain or shine. This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market.

<p>3. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, said optical system comprising a pair of lenses and a pair of prisms arranged to direct said light beams to a particular point, a photo-cell arranged to receive said light beams and convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photo-cell and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. As a general rule, all cameras utilized in a security system for after-the-fact investigation and overall deterrence should be recorded and the recording retained in a 10-day library as a minimum. Many DIY home security systems offer inexpensive professional monitoring and wireless systems with some allowing choice between professional and self-monitoring.</p>
