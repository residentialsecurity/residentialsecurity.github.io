Another feature of intruder alarm systems include motion sensors. Around 170 million surveillance cameras are estimated to be present in China.</p>

ADT now offers a full DIY home security system called Blue by ADT Blue by ADT is the result of ADT's acquisition and merger with LifeShield. Customizable home security packages are available with professional monitoring or self-monitoring.</p>
<p>However, important questions need to be addressed before uncritically accepting the routine surveillance of public spaces, including whether video surveillance is an effective remedy for crime prevention and deterrence and whether it is an appropriate security measure in terms of civil liberties protections. However, as a user, you have to subscribe to the professional monitoring service.</p>
