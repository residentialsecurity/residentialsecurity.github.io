When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
<p>We'll never sell you standard off-the-shelf intruder alarms. It's the ideal choice if you have a security guard who is monitoring a live video feed on site.
