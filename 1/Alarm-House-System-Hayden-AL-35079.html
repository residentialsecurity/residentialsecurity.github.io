<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. Remote Video Surveillance Systems Consist of Intelligent IP Camera Systems, Remote Communications, and Remote Power Systems. With DIY systems, you order everything online and the company ships you the equipment along with step-by-step installation instructions.

According to a survey of convicted burglars , 60% were deterred by the sight of a burglar alarm system, with respondents agreeing that they would opt for a different target should they find their initial one visibly fitted with alarms.

<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
