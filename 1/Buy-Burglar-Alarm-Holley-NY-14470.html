NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>Before you choose a video surveillance camera, make sure you know exactly what you need to survey. Cons: Some security systems may cost you every month for maintenance (while some are not), and you may need to secure your home security cameras for better safety consideration.
