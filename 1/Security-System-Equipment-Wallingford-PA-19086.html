<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A shift from analog to IP technologies, cloud solutions for storage, and rise of video surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) present new, untapped opportunities for security solution providers. The outdoor camera is waterproof, comes with night vision, has a 12x digital zoom to enhance any detail you need to focus on.

<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>
