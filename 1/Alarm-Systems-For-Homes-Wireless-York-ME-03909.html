CCTV is a television system where the signals are not publicly distributed, but are primarily for surveillance and security purposes internally. As long as the magnetic field remains balanced with the door firmly closed, the contacts within the switch would be in no-alarm condition.</p>
<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>Software, appliances, servers, and cameras, all from one source. You'll have to pay a monthly fee for professional monitoring, but self-monitoring is usually free. Homeowners also sometimes install fake security cameras using the same reasoning. Also, Cove currently ships equipment with a Yi camera but doesn't integrate it or any other cameras into the actual system.</p>
