<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Offers may not be combined with certain other promotional offers on the same services and may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment.

<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>C-mount cameras can cover distances beyond 40 ft thanks to the possibility to use special lenses with these cameras, whereas standard CCTV lenses can only cover distances of 35-40 ft.

Circuit alarm systems do an excellent job of protecting the perimeter of your home or business and detecting any breaches in the door or windows.
