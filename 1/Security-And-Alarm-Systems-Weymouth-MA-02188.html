<p>A CODEC is used to convert an analogue video signal to a digital video signal either using hardware or software.

The Smart Surveillance Camera monitors large areas and supports vehicle capture and ANPR.</p>
<p>These cameras are extremely useful in defence locations, in border areas, and other places where you need 24X7 surveillance activities. Appointing security guards is a traditional practice, but with developing technology, a number of surveillance aids are made available.

<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
