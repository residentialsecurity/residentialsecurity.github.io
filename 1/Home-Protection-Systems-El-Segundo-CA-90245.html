<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Offers may not be combined with certain other promotional offers on the same services and may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment. You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>The ownership of the CCTV cameras and broadband network will remain with the BSNL.
