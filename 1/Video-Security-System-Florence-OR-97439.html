<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
<p>Modern technology has made it possible to access the videos from these CCTV security systems live on phones.

<p>Smart home automation technology is increasingly popular in security systems. In today's market, there are three main types of security system packages available: home automation, security equipment, and environmental monitoring. The use of sophisticated systems by police and other public security officials is particularly troubling in a democratic society. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording.</p>
