<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. If you're concerned about privacy and would rather not store your video in the cloud, look for a camera equipped with a microSD card slot so you can store it locally. And Nest's monitoring plans start at $10 per month for a limited basic plan.

In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void.</p>
<p>A boom in wireless security cameras is inspiring a movement in DIY home surveillance. We like the Smart Home Video monitoring plan because it includes security cameras and video monitoring. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>
