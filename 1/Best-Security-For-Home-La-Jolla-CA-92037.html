Home automation equipment can be controlled with voice commands, the Protect America control panel or a mobile app. Premise: Burglar alarm systems can be inaccurate in two ways: they can fail to detect an intruder when one is present, or they can falsely report the presence of an intruder.</p>
<p>This is sold as the Nest Secure alarm system, commanding a premium fee of $399, and it includes a base station, two Nest Tags, and two sensors. Commercial and government sectors would be key end users of CCTV cameras; residential sector to represent potential growth avenues. There are more than 25 million operational CCTV cameras globally, and experts believe that around 67% of the burglaries taking place in businesses could be avoided by installing real-time security measures such as CCTV monitoring.</p>

We have implemented a monitoring and controlling system that monitors weather parameters like temperature, Humidity, Light and poisonous gases.These parameters are sent to the mobile app through Bluetooth communication.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
