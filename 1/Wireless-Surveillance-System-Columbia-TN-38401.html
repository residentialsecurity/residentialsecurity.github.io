Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>

<p>Video doorbells are the most popular security product owned (18.2%) with a professionally monitored home security system (16.2%) as 2nd most popular. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company. Television programs and movies sometimes portray an intruder penetrating a perimeter barrier by breaking through when a CCTV camera had momentarily rotated to another location.</p>
<p>From there, you can add cameras for another $110-$300 to see what's happening at home before calling the police or fire responders. PIR motion sensors are one of the intelligent home security systems that you should buy for your office or home. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service.</p>

Intercom Keypads: Some keypads provide two-way intercoms between your home and the security monitoring company. That's because the base package includes quite a lot of equipment: two recessed contact sensors for doors or windows, four entry sensors for doors, one motion sensor, a siren and a keypad.</p>
<p>Other brands, like Ring and Nest Secure , offer a handful of cool smart devices. Evidence, however, has shown that video surveillance cameras have limited, if any, effects on crime prevention. 2.
