<p>Blue by ADT is completely DIY for an easy, free set-up that doesn't require a professional. There are two main ways to record video images that CCTV cameras capture. Burglar alarm systems serve two basic purposes: alerting those both inside and out of a property to the presence of an intruder and deterring potential criminals from entering a property in the first place.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera has an impressive motion detection feature. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY option. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it allows you to control almost every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly customizable.</p>
<p>Many IP cameras have a built-in SD card. The TSA's Recommended Security Guidelines for Airport Planning, Design, and Construction provide additional guidance to airport operators on how to measure the resolution and overall effectiveness of CCTV systems.
