We evaluate these security cameras not just based on their popularity but also on their pricing, design, setup process, set of features, and overall value. Regardless of the size of your home, or the number of doors and windows or interior rooms a homeowner decides to protect, the only real difference is in the number of security components deployed throughout the home and monitored by the control panel.</p>

The price of professional monitoring will vary based on the equipment you choose. CCTV cameras can be placed in a location of your own choosing, and do not require extensive modifications to your existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Start with detailed description of your security and business requirements and a reliable technology partner that will integrate and deploy the system on your behalf and the sky is the limit.

<p>Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
