Companies can add detectors and sensors for fire, smoke, flood, carbon monoxide and even freezing pipes onto your monthly monitoring service for increased protection.

Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensors in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.</p>
<p>As long as you're willing to commit to a contract, the FrontPoint Safe Home Elite system offers a nice selection of security, home automation, and environmental components and is easy to install.
