<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. DIY monitoring is always available with the free SimpliSafe mobile app. Many security cameras have infrared (IR) light technology, which aids in motion detection and enables the cameras to function in low light. However, in terms of market share, the commercial sector dominates the global CCTV camera market The commercial segment is expected to reach a market size of over US$ 13,100 Mn by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>While the company has an A rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), its overall customer rating is just over 1 star out of 5.
