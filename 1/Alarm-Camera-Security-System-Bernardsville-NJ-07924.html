Video analytics enhances video surveillance systems by performing the tasks of real-time event detection, post-event analysis, and extraction of statistical data while saving manpower costs and increasing the effectiveness of the surveillance system operation.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>
