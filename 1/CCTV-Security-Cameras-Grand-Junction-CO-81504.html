<p>Heightened physical security concerns spanning all industries, coupled with technological advancements is driving the requirement for higher camera resolutions, more fields of view with wider dynamic range and longer storage retention periods. Planting cameras at crucial and suitable points is a cost-effective way to monitor and document people and vehicles arriving and departing certain facility. Additionally, devices that connect via Wi-Fi, such as security cameras and smart door locks, can be hacked to gain access to your home network. And some brands don't sell smart equipment of their own but do integrate with common smart home systems.</p>
<p>Hybrid systems use both wired and wireless sensors to achieve the benefits of both. Ring dominates the home security space with their user-friendly, tech-driven appliances for all aspects of your smart home. The best wireless home security systems are simple to install and can be professionally monitored or self-monitored.
