As previously mentioned, CCTV DVRs have a multiplexer built in which enables the user to view multiple images on the screen at any given time by segregating the screen image. The result is the broadest security infrastructure portfolio available from any single vendor, from high-performance NVRs, to hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), to the largest shared storage and archive solutions, to analytics processing.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>

Some small retailers selling unbranded cameras may only offer a statutory six month product guarantee at best, which you might find yourself fighting for, if the camera fails within that time frame.</p>

<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
<p>If you want to keep an eye on what's happening in your home when you're not there, but you don't want to invest in a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look. The top security companies offer security suites that integrate a variety of features. These cameras, both hardwired and wireless, transmit images over the Internet, often compressing the bandwidth so as not to overwhelm the web.</p>
