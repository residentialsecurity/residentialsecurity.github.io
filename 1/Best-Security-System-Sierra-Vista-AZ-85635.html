<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Combining the performance and reliability of local recording with the convenience and flexibility of the cloud, OpenEye Web Services produces a greater return on your investment, saves you time, and provides an easier, more secure surveillance solution. Other devices you can add to your system include door panels, access sensors, motion sensors, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, glass break sensors, door lock pads, and water sensors.</p>
