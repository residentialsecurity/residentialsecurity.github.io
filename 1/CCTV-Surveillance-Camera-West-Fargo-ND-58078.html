While IC Realtime offers cloud-based analytics that can upgrade existing, dumb cameras, other companies are building artificial intelligence directly into their hardware. Keep in mind that surveillance is often understood most of the times as a violation of your privacy, a lot of activists are against surveillance systems in homes and private locations, and likely are establishing that surveillance is only good in public spaces where public safety can be at risk.</p>
<p>Using two clamp-on sensors and a 240V breaker, the Sense monitor samples current and voltage one million times per second to determine where your energy is going. It's the same with the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera in that it can be pretty expensive compared to the competition, and you need to unlock its full potential by subscribing to the versatile yet costly cloud storage plan.</p>

<p>The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable.
