<p>Founded in 2004, Ohio AMS has been proudly serving Ohio's courts and corrections industry with high quality monitoring products and services for over a decade. We expect this trend to continue in the future and for the cybersecurity maturity gap between this industry and other high-tech industries to continue to shrink as more external pressure is applied on the people managing physical security systems. Another feature of intruder alarm systems include motion sensors. Around 170 million surveillance cameras are estimated to be present in China.</p>
<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from deterring criminals. Melissa Ngo, EPIC, Chapter: You Are Being Watched But Not Protected: The Myth of Security Under Camera Surveillance, in the book "Intersection: Sidewalks & Public Space" (Chain 2008).</p>

That is where Akita steps in and adds a layer that analyses the data packets being to and from these smart devices on your network—and immediately raises an alarm if something is amiss.</p>
<p>IP cameras are the more modern iteration of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little more expensive, they offer a number of features that analog cameras do not.

<p>Most movable cameras allow the person monitoring it to move the camera from right to left (pan), up and down (tilt), and from a tight angle to a wide angle (close up zoom). Moreover, with their solid design, PT Series cameras operate steadily at great heights. Hard drives that are built inside a digital video recorder, network video recorder or server represents the internal storage.</p>
