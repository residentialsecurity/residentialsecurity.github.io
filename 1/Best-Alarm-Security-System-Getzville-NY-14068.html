Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage.</p>

<p>Video surveillance camera vendors, who have access to extensive technical and financial resources are anticipated to gain a competitive edge over their rivals, as they have the capacity to cater to the global market requirements.

These devices will record video when the doorbell ringer is pressed or when motion is detected, and in most cases can be programmed to trigger other system devices such as door locks and interior cameras. Though unmonitored systems are often smartphone compatible, you'll be tasked with monitoring them yourself.</p>
