<h4>Wireless Security Home System Ellijay 30540</h4>
<p>AxxonSoft and Hikvision are creating joint solutions in the areas of IP video surveillance, intelligent video analysis, and integrated security systems. In the wake of the terror attacks in Mumbai, the Ahmedabad Police has decided to install 300 CCTV cameras at over 100 important locations across the city. CCTV cameras — mushrooming everywhere in India in public, private and commercial spaces — can be exploited as tools for illegal surveillance and even hacking.</p>
<p>You can then connect elements to it, depending on the system you choose, including motion sensors, cameras, and lighting sockets that allow you to switch lights on and off when you're out. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>Video image processing ( VIP ) identifies vehicles and their associated traffic flow parameters by analysing imagery supplied from CCTV cameras which normally have a fixed field of view. It has to be noted that this is the number of CCTV cameras available with the police and not the total number of CCTV cameras in the state. Multiple streams and angles of high-resolution surveillance comes with a price, requiring up to 20 times more storage capacity that lower-resolution video captured with older technology.</p>
