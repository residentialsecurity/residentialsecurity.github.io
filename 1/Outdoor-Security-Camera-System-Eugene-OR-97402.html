Though these surveillance cameras have relatively discrete appearance, it still has a great effect in deterring criminals. Most frequently it is used in video surveillance systems and can provide a storage of 2 TB to 4 TB. The system is also subject to false alarms resulting from automobile headlights, lightning flashes and so forth, entering the receiver. Our local reseller offers several levels of service, each of which offers different features, but with a similar up-front cost of about $300.</p>
