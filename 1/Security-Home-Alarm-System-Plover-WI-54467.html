<p>CCTV cameras system recorders: DVR (digital video recorder) which record onto hard drives is the best option. For doors and windows switches are provided which are open as long as the door or window is closed, but which, on being released by opening the door or windows, automatically close the circuit. Of these criteria, one of the most important in aviation security is the overall resolution of the image along with its field of view.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
