However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>And they won't use your WiFi or slow it down unless you access the security cameras for remote viewing or the cameras send you alerts when motion is detected.

<p>It's one of the best systems we've tested, with customizable alarm triggers and consistent monitoring response times. These cameras share the images across the internet, so CCTV footage can be easily accessed. The company specializes in 100% wireless systems able to be controlled through the company's mobile app. Cameras that capture 4K (Ultra HD) video are also available, but you'll need a very strong network connection to stream it without experiencing choppiness or lag, and you'll need lots of room to store recorded video, which may result in expensive cloud storage fees.</p>
<p>Fort Knox® has worked hard to gain a good reputation with our Houston customers as a company with low rates and quick response times, thanks to our technicians with 20+ years of experience, and our company-owned monitoring center.
