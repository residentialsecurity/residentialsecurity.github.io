Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment. You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>

Appropriate help is summoned when the alarm is activated, whether you are home or not, even when the security system is not armed.
