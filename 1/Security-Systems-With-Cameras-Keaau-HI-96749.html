<p>Be it a video intercom system or video door phone, they bring optimum security to your home, especially if there are kids at home or work from home alone. ADT has more monitoring centers and more experience than any other home security company. For this reason, you may want to program your cameras to record only during certain times of the day or when they detect movement.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
