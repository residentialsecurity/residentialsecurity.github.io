<p>A smart TV, media players connected to the TV, smart lights, smart appliances, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, smart displays such as Amazon Echo Show and Google Nest Hub, smart cameras, a water purifier or air purifier that connects with the internet and so on.

<p>If you have a large home or property that needs comprehensive coverage, wired systems are a better option because they can support more cameras. You'll also want the option to self-monitor your system using a mobile app for smartphone controls. However, larger systems involving multiple sensors will invariably have a separate control unit.
