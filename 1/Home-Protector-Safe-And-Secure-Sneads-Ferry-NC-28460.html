<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
<p>Beyond the specification of a proper edge computing architecture, video surveillance systems deployers have to deal with other challenges as well. The positive terminal 12 of battery 10 is connected through an appropriate cable 14 which connects the battery 10 to the alternator 18 and to other electrical loads represented by block 20. These loads include the engine ignition system, accessories, lights, etc.</p>
