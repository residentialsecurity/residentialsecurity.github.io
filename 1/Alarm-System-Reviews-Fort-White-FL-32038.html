The system of video surveillance in the center and adjacent territories and premises is built on basis of remote sensitive video cameras. Depending on how your system is set up, one of two things will happen-either a high-decibel alarm will sound or a silent alarm will be sent to your ADT monitoring station.</p>
<p>The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>

The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously.
