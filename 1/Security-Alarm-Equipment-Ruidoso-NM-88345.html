If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house.

<p>Important thing to note here is that in Window Sensor, current is always passing until there is a breakage in glass of a window. To be effective, however, your home security must be visible to potential criminals, such as security cameras, the use of stickers and signs, and the strategic use of lighting.
