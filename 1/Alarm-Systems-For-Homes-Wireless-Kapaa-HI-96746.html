Fraunhofer's smart alarm system, which uses light instead of electricity and fiber optics instead of copper wires, recognizes patterns to avoid false alarms.

As for iPhones and other iOS devices, Apple's built-in security makes life tough both for malware coders and antivirus writers.</p>

<p>That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. By using the latest technology and our years of expertise in high-speed video capture, we have built a portfolio of products designed for surveillance, physical security, and smart buildings. Many cameras also offer a software zoom feature (which is not the same thing as having a physical zoom lens).</p>
