CCTV Digital video recorders have various settings to enable more video information to be recorded at the required times using technology such as video motion detection, this means that the images from the cctv cameras are only recorded when the information of the image changes, for example a person walking in front of the cctv camera.</p>

<p>This makes it one of the few security systems that works with Apple's smart hub. In general, homeowners are allowed to have outdoor security cameras that cover a broad area, and it's usually OK to capture your neighbor's public-facing property in the background of your footage. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
