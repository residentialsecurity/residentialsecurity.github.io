<p>Network cameras are ideal for both domestic and commercial purposes because you can see what's going on whilst away from the property. A few years ago, you'd need to budget thousands in order to create a video monitoring, web-connected, home security system, but today you can install a few affordable wireless sensors, a connected motion-sensing camera and enjoy 24-7 home monitoring, with alerts sent direct to your phone from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This convenient storage allows you to access your clips at any time from your home's control panel, the Vivint Smart Home app , or your online account. Although not readily available in many remote home monitoring systems, a camera with this feature can receive sound, usually via a microphone, emitting sound through a speaker, or both. In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void.</p>

In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
