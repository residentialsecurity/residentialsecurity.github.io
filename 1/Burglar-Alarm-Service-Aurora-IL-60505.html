<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>If you want to add extras like cameras or security lighting, the up-front equipment price gets a lot steeper—but there's no company that can beat Ring's $10 a month monitoring fee. Explosion proof cameras can protect your employees from any disaster or accident beforehand, and also provide real-time support. As a bonus, most insurers provide reduced rates when home monitoring systems are installed.</p>

Within five years, industry watchers say, remote monitoring systems will be standard add-ons to your cable or phone service. Wireless CCTV cameras were created to minimise installation time They also make the appearance of the camera much tidier, which may be an important factor for locations such as churches, museums or stately homes.</p>
