<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. ADT security systems require professional installation. Digital cameras are becoming the industry standard for their resolution and the ability to store tons of data on hard drives, rather than videotapes. As you compare home security systems, it helps to understand the difference between wired or wireless systems and monitored or unmonitored alarms. Find a provider that offers an appropriate trial period to allow time for you to test out of your equipment.</p>
<p>Burglar alarm circuits are triggered in a variety of ways. CCTV was initially developed as a means to increase security for banks but over time it has developed into a cost effective means of general video surveillance and home security.

<p>Wireless home security system: Wireless home alarm systems utilize a series of battery-powered sensors to alert homeowners of potential intrusions. If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address. Varifocal cameras allow you to adjust the focal length, the angle and increase or decrease the zoom - ideal for obtaining footage in a square room where you would normally experience a ‘dead zone' with any alternative, fixed lense camera.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Abode is the only security provider we've seen that offers temporary professional monitoring. ADT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can control your security system with your voice. Crowd Detection is ideal for public surveillance applications where the volume of people needs to be monitored for public safety or quality of service. Households can avail this security feature by downloading and installing ‘LHMS AP Police' or the 4th Lion app.</p>
