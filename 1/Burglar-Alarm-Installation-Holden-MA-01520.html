<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. Moreover, cameras can be placed in areas that require security such as parking spots, VIP areas, schools, restaurants & hotels, bank locker rooms, hospitals, etc.</p>
<p>And they won't use your WiFi or slow it down unless you access the security cameras for remote viewing or the cameras send you alerts when motion is detected.
