<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Red Lion</h3>
<p>6. In a protective alarm system, means for creating two light beams extending across an area to be protected, means for converting said beams into electrical energy, means for chopping said beams in such a manner that the output of said converting means is constant and will vary in voltage when one of said beams is modified by an intruder in said area and indicating means responsive to said varying electrical energy.</p>
<p>These types of camera systems allow you to stream video to your smartphone, tablet or desktop computer; and will even send you notifications if they detect motion. While having the monitoring data from RPA's Passive House projects will be very useful, it will be even more valuable to aggregate the data from all PHIUS certified Passive House projects into a single repository so we can compare information across climate zones furthering the climate adaptive standards.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras over fixed access points are often tied directly to the ACS. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data. Stay connected to your ADT home security system and smart home devices on the go with your favorite mobile device. CCTV cameras placed in strategic locations can deter such employees from going ahead with their plans, therefore leading to a much safer work environment.</p>

<p>2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
