<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. Video surveillance, access control and alarms have much in common, and they often work together as an integrated system to keep intruders out of secure areas, limit access to security sensitive areas, and remotely monitor critical areas to reduce the risk of crime and security incidents. You can also check out our guide to the best home security cameras for more options.</p>
<p>Beyond the specification of a proper edge computing architecture, video surveillance systems deployers have to deal with other challenges as well.

<p>However, CMOS sensor-based CCTV cameras are overshadowing their CCD counterparts in myriads of industrial use cases. Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. video analytics Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts.</p>
