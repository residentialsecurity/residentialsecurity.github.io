<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. That's especially true if you've already sunk money into other Nest gear like the thermostat or cameras Instead of getting a separate security system, you can get one that syncs with your current equipment and uses the same app you're already used to. The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>Where movable cctv cameras are used a zoom lens is usually fitted to allow varying points of a monitored area to be viewed. Appropriate help is summoned when the alarm is activated, whether you are home or not, even when the security system is not armed. It will alert you on your smartphone and email if there is an unnatural motion in the periphery of the camera.</p>
