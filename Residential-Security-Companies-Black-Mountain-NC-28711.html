The second connection is a sense input along line 28 to the negative terminal of the battery to pick up the voltage drop across battery cable 24. Finally, a power lead 30 serves to connect the circuitry to the positive battery terminal 12 so that the circuitry will have operating power.</p>

Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>

Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
