Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>

<p>At a minimum your system should have 1-3 cameras, a DVR (digital video recorder), appropriate wiring (siamese and BNC cables), and power cords. When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed. Home Value Monitoring is free, and it only takes a minute to set up. Just enter the address of the property you want to monitor â€” it's that easy.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the increasing penetration of home security systems, the DIY systems become an attractive alternative for newer customers with average disposable incomes. Though some burglar alarms are successfully triggered by the unexpected motion caused by break-ins, studies have shown that an audible alarm may not always have the intended effect. In general, the customer reviews regarding the quality of service are positive, which can sometimes be hard to find in the home security business.</p>
<p>Depending upon the zone triggered, number and sequence of zones, time of day, and other factors, the alarm monitoring center may automatically initiate various actions. We looked for DIY systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. If any home owner is going out of town, he should have to place a request in the app and indicate the period of his or her police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera unit is linked to the owner's phone and also to the Police Control Room.</p>
