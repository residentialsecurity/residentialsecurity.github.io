<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Both types of security cameras can be purchased as standalone units, complete with either a monitoring app or a subscription-based monitoring system. See the benefits of enabling edge-based storage in VSaaS applications and the value proposition of Micron's surveillance-grade edge storage solutions.
