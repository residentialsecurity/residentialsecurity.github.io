<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors.

We have security cameras and systems to fit all budgets, for the home, small business, law enforcement, or factory. Don't settle for cheap, low quality camera systems from big box stores will leave you unsatisfied with video clarity they have to offer, or the lack of support from a call center located halfway around the world.</p>
<p>Both analog and IP cameras use CCDs, and the number of pixels across their horizontal and vertical dimensions is an important factor in determining image resolution. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all.</p>
