<p>Founded in 2004, Ohio AMS has been proudly serving Ohio's courts and corrections industry with high quality monitoring products and services for over a decade. Huawei Smart Campus Video Surveillance Solution helps our customers build a comprehensive security system to improve living and vehicle travel efficiency and achieve visualized, digital, and intelligent management. With the new ColorVu Technology, Turbo HD ColorVu Cameras render clear images at 0.0005 lux, providing critical surveillance in ultra low-light scenarios.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>

Today's best systems feature high-resolution cameras with motion detection, night vision, mobile access, cloud storage, and more.</p>
<p>Nest thoughtfully designs its equipment and packages too; it includes two key fobs with every security equipment package—that's normally an add-on. It's professionally installed, it will look good in your house, and it supports a ton of smart home devices. The Eufy Security app also offers the ability to set activity zones, so you can draw a box on the screen to specify the area you're interested in. This is vital if you have a camera that overlooks a busy road, for example.</p>

A key offering is SMART Connect, a free home security smartphone app developed by Protect America that allows remote control from anywhere, and is available for both Android and iOS.</p>
