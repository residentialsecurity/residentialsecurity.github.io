That's because the base package includes quite a lot of equipment: two recessed contact sensors for doors or windows, four entry sensors for doors, one motion sensor, a siren and a keypad.</p>
<p>Depending upon the zone triggered, number and sequence of zones, time of day, and other factors, the alarm monitoring center may automatically initiate various actions. We looked for DIY systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without a contract.
