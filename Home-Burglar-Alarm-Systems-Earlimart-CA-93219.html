Alternately, battery-operated remote wireless sensors and controls can be installed.</p>
<p>In place of the source of illumination 87 and cell 88 or in combination therewith and the other devices, we may employ a bulb or source of light 92 in combinatlon with alight-sensitive cell 94 connected through a battery 89 with an amplifier vacuum tube 95. From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>
<p>It offers a huge range of features, from the standard motion and entry sensors to indoor and outdoor cameras, plus video doorbell and extensive integration with smart home systems. Some work with other smart devices such as door locks and sirens and support IFTTT and Alexa voice commands. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network.</p>
<p>Crowd Detection is a Senstar Symphony or edge-based video analytic that estimates the number of people within a given area in real time and triggers an alarm when a specified number of people (capacity) or a specified percentage of people (occupancy) is reached. The single biggest advantage for these wifi CCTV cameras are that they can be viewed remotely from anywhere in the world and some of them can also be controlled via smartphone apps.</p>
