<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Cable 24 serves as a shunt resistor in the sense that whenever current is drawn from or charged to the battery, a voltage is created across cable 24. It is this voltage drop which provides the basic input signal to the circuitry illustrated in FIG. Be it IP cameras, megapixel cameras, HD-CCTV, video management systems (VMS), DVRs, compression, systems integration, monitors, fiber, analytics, WiFi or mesh networks, you'll find it here.</p>
<p>Burglar alarm circuits are triggered in a variety of ways. CCTV was initially developed as a means to increase security for banks but over time it has developed into a cost effective means of general video surveillance and home security.
