You can also check out our guide to the best home security cameras for more options.</p>
<p>Aside from receiving video clips whenever motion is detected, an alarm is activated, or a sensor is triggered, it's easy to schedule your surveillance system to automatically record at certain times.

Several cameras can be interconnected to a single monitor located in a security room.
