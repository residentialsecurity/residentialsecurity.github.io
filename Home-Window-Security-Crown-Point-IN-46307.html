<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Your cameras and NVR connect via a network switch or router. Our Managed Digital Video Surveillance service gives you a state of the art service you can customize to your needs and bank on to deliver. When comparing home security systems, consider the cost of equipment, monitoring and installation, plus fees for activation, termination and local alarm permits.</p>

Some home security companies sell alarms and equipment individually, and others offer packages of bundled devices.</p>

IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio).

<p>Software, appliances, servers, and cameras, all from one source. You'll have to pay a monthly fee for professional monitoring, but self-monitoring is usually free. Homeowners also sometimes install fake security cameras using the same reasoning.
