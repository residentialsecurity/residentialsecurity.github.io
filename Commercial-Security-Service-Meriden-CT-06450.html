<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera equipment. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>

We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats.

The control panel may then communicate with you or the security company by either a wired or wireless connection - often WiFi, Bluetooth or a cellular signal. CCTV cameras also have the potential of creating unintended effects, good and bad.</p>
