<p>Using two clamp-on sensors and a 240V breaker, the Sense monitor samples current and voltage one million times per second to determine where your energy is going. It's the same with the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera in that it can be pretty expensive compared to the competition, and you need to unlock its full potential by subscribing to the versatile yet costly cloud storage plan.</p>
