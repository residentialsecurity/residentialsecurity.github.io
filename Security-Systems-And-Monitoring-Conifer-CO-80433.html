Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Recent advances in signal processing enable the development of intelligent video surveillance systems, notably systems that can flexibly adapt the rate of video data collection.
