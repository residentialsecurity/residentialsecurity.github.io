<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>As long as you're willing to commit to a contract, the FrontPoint Safe Home Elite system offers a nice selection of security, home automation, and environmental components and is easy to install. The primary feature of these CCTV cameras is that they can work in low light conditions.
