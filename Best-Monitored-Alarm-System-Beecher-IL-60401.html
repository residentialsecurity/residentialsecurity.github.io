Monitoring fees begin at $29, and equipment costs range from $299 to $499. Whether you need a widespread system that can cover multiple locations or just a few cameras to watch your storefront, there's a solution for everyone.</p>

<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use. But this alarm company delivers more in a basic package (like smoke and carbon monoxide monitoring) than many other home security companies, which explains why you'll find higher entry-level prices.</p>

<p>Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. As a general rule, all cameras utilized in a security system for after-the-fact investigation and overall deterrence should be recorded and the recording retained in a 10-day library as a minimum. Many DIY home security systems offer inexpensive professional monitoring and wireless systems with some allowing choice between professional and self-monitoring.</p>
