Here, Akita is a security device that is wary of strangers and anyone with a malicious intent who may be eyeing the smart devices in your Internet of Things (IoT) home. The majority of CCTV cameras and Video Camcorders use a CCD imaging sensor, whereas CMOS imaging sensors are more commonly used in webcams, budget home security cameras and digital photography cameras.</p>

ADT's response time averages a respectable 45 seconds, and they have multiple monitoring centers so their reliability is second to none.</p>
