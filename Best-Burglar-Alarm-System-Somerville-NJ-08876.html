<p>7. In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting a beam across said opening, an optical system arranged to divide the light from said source into two beams, means for receiving said light beams and converting said beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, a light chopper arranged so that the output of said receiving means is constant and to vary the voltage of said energy when one of said beams is intercepted by an intruder and means responsive to the varying volt- 85 age for operating an alarm system.</p>
<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Somerville</h3>
<p>I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>And call your security company to wire upper-story windows into your alarm system. Depending on the shape and size, you have different types of CCTV cameras classified as box camera, dome camera, bullet camera, board camera, and hidden camera.

<p>It offers a huge range of features, from the standard motion and entry sensors to indoor and outdoor cameras, plus video doorbell and extensive integration with smart home systems. Some work with other smart devices such as door locks and sirens and support IFTTT and Alexa voice commands. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network.</p>

<p>Suggestions include rotating personnel every 2 h, limit TV monitors to fewer than 10, arrange monitors in a curved configuration in front of the viewer, control the lighting over the console to avoid glare on the monitor screens or tilt the monitors if necessary, place the monitors in an order that permits easy recognition of camera locations, provide a swivel chair that hampers the opportunity for sleeping, and assign tasks to the viewer (e.g., communications and logging).</p>
<p>8. In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage and alarm means responsive to said energy.</p>
