<p>A boom in wireless security cameras is inspiring a movement in DIY home surveillance. We like the Smart Home Video monitoring plan because it includes security cameras and video monitoring. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>
