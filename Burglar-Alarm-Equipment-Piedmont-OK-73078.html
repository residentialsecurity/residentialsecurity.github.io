A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

<p>The main purpose of coming up with this project is to build an automatic greenhouse monitoring in which GSM module sends the information about temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture and status of appliances (fans, sprays, artificial lights and water pump) that are connected with circuit for controlling greenhouse effects or greenhouse parameters (temperature, humidity, light intensity and water supply for plants).</p>
<p>DIY installation with self-monitoring: Some brands we recommend, like Ring, Abode, and Nest, offer both professional and self-monitoring. Others like ADT and Vivint offer professionally installed systems only but typically provide their own installers. Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for every camera you install, including the Nest Hello doorbell. In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm.</p>
<p>However, if entry to the vehicle is authorized and the engine is started within the 15 second or 30 second time interval as selected by switch 88, then charge comparator 42 is switched to provide a positive logic output, which resets arming timer 50 and flip-flop 72. If the output of flip-flop 72 drops to a zero logic level before timeout of entry delay timer 86, then no output pulse is provided by timer 86 and no alarm is sounded.</p>
