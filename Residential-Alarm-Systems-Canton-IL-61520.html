The scopes like prevention, detection, and intervention which have led to the development of real and consistent video surveillance systems are capable of intelligent video processing competencies. With so many security applications entailing dozens of cameras and 24×7 video streams, it soon becomes apparent that a typical NVR system's storage requirements can easily reach beyond 10 TB. In the following three examples, the varying video profiles of different security environments (and the storage capacities they require) are compared.</p>
<p>Many people who are looking for DIY home security solutions want systems that they can install and monitor themselves. DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need them—perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs. CCTV is different from broadcast television as all the equipment is directly connected together with cables or wireless transmitters that can not be received by standard television aerials or transmissions of the video signals are only intended to be accessible by the equipment on its dedicated closed circuit.</p>
