<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft.

<p>Should a monitored door or window suddenly be opened, the security circuit is broken and the control panel interprets this as a breach of a secured zone. Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>
<p>There are also rising concerns over people's privacy that is interrupted by excessive use of CCTV cameras worldwide. A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include many of the same features as their monitored counterpart, including sensors, alarms, and cameras, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the costly monthly expenses associated with monitored security systems.</p>
