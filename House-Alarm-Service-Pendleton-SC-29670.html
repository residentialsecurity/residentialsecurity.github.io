<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>Hybrid systems use both wired and wireless sensors to achieve the benefits of both. Ring dominates the home security space with their user-friendly, tech-driven appliances for all aspects of your smart home. The best wireless home security systems are simple to install and can be professionally monitored or self-monitored. Every technology attached to a security system draws current, and this is measured in milliamps, for example: a control panel generally has a 1 Amp power supply built into it, from that we need to deduct the power need for every PIR, Shock sensor, Bell box etc.</p>

In both cases, though, what these firms are currently offering is just the tip of the iceberg. Growing concern about public safety is prompting wider deployment of video surveillance by government agencies, private organizations, and consumers. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%).</p>
