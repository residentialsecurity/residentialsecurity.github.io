Vivint offers two levels of monitoring service , and with Vivint cameras, you can also opt into video monitoring to allow agents to visually investigate alarms. Bullet surveillance cameras come with an iconic, highly visible design. You can access video anytime with cloud storage, and you can remotely adjust each camera's settings. Serving over one million customers, Brinks Home Security bridges the gap between do-it-yourself smart home security and traditional professionally monitored systems.</p>

It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular.
