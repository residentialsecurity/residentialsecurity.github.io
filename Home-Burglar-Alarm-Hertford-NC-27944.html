<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Just as a suggestion and maybe useful tip, if you are actually working with more than one or two cameras, you might want to set up a surveillance spot or hub, the central point or your hole security operation, you for sure will want to keep everything in one place, that will guarantee easy access and a lot of comforts when you are setting up everything.</p>
