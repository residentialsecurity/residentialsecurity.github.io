<p>The Mi Home Security Camera Basic 1080p does not store any data on the cloud (unlike Yi, which gives you a 30-day free cloud storage for your video feeds and you can opt for different plans to get more storage) Having a cloud storage is a better option as you are assured that your video feeds are not corrupted in the micro SD card or not lost if the camera itself is stolen or damaged.</p>
<p>This convenient storage allows you to access your clips at any time from your home's control panel, the Vivint Smart Home app , or your online account. Although not readily available in many remote home monitoring systems, a camera with this feature can receive sound, usually via a microphone, emitting sound through a speaker, or both. In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
