<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. That's especially true if you've already sunk money into other Nest gear like the thermostat or cameras Instead of getting a separate security system, you can get one that syncs with your current equipment and uses the same app you're already used to. The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>The key players profiled in the video surveillance industry include HKVISION, Ltd., Bosch Security System, Honeywell Security Group, Dahua Technology, FLIR, Panasonic, Avigilon, Axis Communication, Infinova, and Pelco.

The Engage platform comes solar ready and allows for real-time energy monitoring on an app and a desktop. All in all, Vivint is an excellent provider of state-of-the-art security systems and home automation technology if customers can afford the high equipment price, though choosing the 60-month financing plan can lighten the burden somewhat.</p>
<p>Though the police claim the cameras are a blessing, residents and experts have voiced concerns about privacy.

We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats.
