<p>CCTV camera footage is exceptionally important if a crime is committed either within your office premises or around it.

<p>Keep an eye on your home with home alert systems that remotely monitor and control your home, vacation property or small business. By pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Another type of home security controller, the all-in-one, is actually a security camera that usually contains several wireless radios, motion and sound sensors, and a siren designed to scare off uninvited guests and warn you of an intrusion.</p>
<p>Video doorbells are the most popular security product owned (18.2%) with a professionally monitored home security system (16.2%) as 2nd most popular. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company. Television programs and movies sometimes portray an intruder penetrating a perimeter barrier by breaking through when a CCTV camera had momentarily rotated to another location.</p>
