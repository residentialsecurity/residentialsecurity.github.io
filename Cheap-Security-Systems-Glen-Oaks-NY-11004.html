Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>

With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are. Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.</p>

Whether you want a simple alarm system or a full smart home ensemble, these top home security systems give you total control.
