<p>The US government has found similar vulnerabilities in the products of the Chinese firm involved in the controversy regarding Delhi government's order of 1.5 lakh CCTV cameras. It played a huge role in turning video doorbells and wireless security cameras into the everyday items they are now. The first thing to consider if you're in the market for a home security system is whether you want professional monitoring or a DIY self-monitoring kit.</p>
<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>

Professional home security systems allow you that peace of mind, helping you monitor the wellbeing of your loved ones.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe's contact sensors for doors and windows are small enough to be camouflaged when installed on white trim; the motion sensor is noticeable, but not an eyesore. Perhaps even more disturbing is the idea of some stranger monitoring video from your indoor and outdoor security cameras. Customized equipment packages come with anywhere between 3 to 12 devices including base stations and keypads, entry sensors, motion sensors, and sirens.</p>
