<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors. Today, the most pop recorders include an NVR (Network Video Recorder), a DVR (Digital Video Recorder), a computer (the hard drive on the computer actually), a Micro SD card, the FTP server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike. Founded in 1999, Vivint has positioned itself as a next generation home security services provider with an emphasis on home automation and integration with smart home devices.</p>

<p>However, if entry to the vehicle is authorized and the engine is started within the 15 second or 30 second time interval as selected by switch 88, then charge comparator 42 is switched to provide a positive logic output, which resets arming timer 50 and flip-flop 72. If the output of flip-flop 72 drops to a zero logic level before timeout of entry delay timer 86, then no output pulse is provided by timer 86 and no alarm is sounded.</p>
