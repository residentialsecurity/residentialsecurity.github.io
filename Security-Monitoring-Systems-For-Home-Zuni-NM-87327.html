A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
