However, most hardwired systems require professional installation.</p>
<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify.
