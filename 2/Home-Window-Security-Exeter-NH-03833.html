According to a recent report by Mordor Intelligence, the video surveillance market was valued at $29.98 billion in 2016, and is expected to reach a value of $72.19 billion by 2022. DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well.</p>
<p>Base stations are the center of a security system, using WiFi and wireless technology to connect all the various sensors, cameras, and other system components. Wired home security cameras send data through a closed circuit, not over a signal.

<p>To further give you peace of mind, SimpliSafe offers a 60-day money-back guarantee, more than double the time you get with many other home security services. Nest Secure is a perfect home security system if you want a fully DIY security and smart home system. Spy cameras are miniature cameras which you can place discreetly to monitor specific areas.

Its entry sensors also function as motion sensors and come with thoughtful features like Quiet Open (which lets you open a single door without setting off the whole alarm) and Pathlight (where a night light turns on when you walk by).</p>
