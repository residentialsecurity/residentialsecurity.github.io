Professional installation can cost over $200, but the benefit is you ensure your home security equipment is properly functioning in your home. New ADT customers can take advantage of ADT Pulse features and benefits with the new and improved, ADT Control system. The connections are sometimes so contrived that the reclosing of the door or window will not stop the bell from ringing.</p>
