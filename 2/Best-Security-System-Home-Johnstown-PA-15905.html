DIY monitoring is always available with the free SimpliSafe mobile app. Many security cameras have infrared (IR) light technology, which aids in motion detection and enables the cameras to function in low light.

However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>

In Moscow, a similar infrastructure is being assembled, with facial recognition software plugged into a centralized system of more than 100,000 high-resolution cameras which cover more than 90 percent of the city's apartment entrances.</p>

The Mi Home Security Camera Basic sports a full HD 1080p sensor that also has a viewing angle of 130 degrees and helps you capture a wider area of your surveillance spot. Ultra Series Cameras capture ultra-high quality and high definition videos. The Frontpoint alarm panel also serves as a Z-wave smart home hub, but its ability to integrate with some top smart home brands (like Google Nest) is limited.</p>
<p>After more than two years of long-term use and testing of a raft of new models, we still think the Google Nest Cam Outdoor is the best outdoor security camera. Not only does smart technology give you the ability to control and monitor your home alarm system from anywhere—it also makes your system able to respond to your habits and routines. Siren Several one-box systems like Canary and Somfy come with a very loud built-in siren that should hopefully scare off intruders (or next door's cat).</p>
