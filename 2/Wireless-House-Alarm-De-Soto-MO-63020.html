<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>Modern technology has made it possible to access the videos from these CCTV security systems live on phones. AxxonSoft's intelligent VMS software powered by Huawei's outstanding computing solutions maximizes public and business security.

Acquisition and collaboration of market players is one of the key strategies followed by leading CCTV camera providers in the market.</p>
