<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>

<p>Wireless home security system: Wireless home alarm systems utilize a series of battery-powered sensors to alert homeowners of potential intrusions. If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address. Varifocal cameras allow you to adjust the focal length, the angle and increase or decrease the zoom - ideal for obtaining footage in a square room where you would normally experience a ‘dead zone' with any alternative, fixed lense camera.</p>

This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market.

By using PCS VSaaS, clients have a one-stop-shop solution for end-to-end implementation of video surveillance solution with options to retain information in a central cloud storage.

Security systems have recently adopted cellular technology, making them easier than ever to install without professional help.</p>
<p>Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. As a general rule, all cameras utilized in a security system for after-the-fact investigation and overall deterrence should be recorded and the recording retained in a 10-day library as a minimum. Many DIY home security systems offer inexpensive professional monitoring and wireless systems with some allowing choice between professional and self-monitoring.</p>
