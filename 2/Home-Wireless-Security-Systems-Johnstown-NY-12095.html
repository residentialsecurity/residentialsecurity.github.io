Launching the project at Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, Kejriwal said over 1,000 Delhi government schools will be equipped with CCTV cameras by November this year. So we mounted the sensors and set up a few security cameras, along with a video doorbell camera to see how well it secured our home.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>There are more than 10 types of security systems there like CCTV camera, PIR sensors, video door phone, digital safe, biometric door lock, etc. Time lapse VCR's allow cctv camera images to be recorded for varying lengths of time on a single 3 hour video tape, from lengths of 3 hours to over 960 hours.

Many providers have a mobile app that you can install for remotely managing your home security system, checking cameras, and checking notifications.</p>
