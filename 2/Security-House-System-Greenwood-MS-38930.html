<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
