<p>And sometimes, motion sensors can do the job of several entry sensors. This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>To go further, within 725 we find that the requirements and standards for the input power to the panel is found in Chapter 9 Tables 11 and 12. Some other requirements for alarm systems include where it cannot be located. Here again, however, this approach is not practical for long-term monitoring.
