Digital cameras are becoming the industry standard for their resolution and the ability to store tons of data on hard drives, rather than videotapes.

<p>Wireless home security system: Wireless home alarm systems utilize a series of battery-powered sensors to alert homeowners of potential intrusions. If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address.

This eliminates the need for cables, allowing installation to be much simpler than wired security cameras.
