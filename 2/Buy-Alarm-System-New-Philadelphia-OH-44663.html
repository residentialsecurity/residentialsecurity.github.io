<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business.

We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>

Your ADT smart security technician can help ensure you're getting the right solution for your needs, and help set up your system so it's ready to go.</p>
<p>These cameras do not require a video capture card because they work using a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer.
