<h3>Attempting to Outsmart a Home Security System in Savage</h3>
<p>I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>

The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips.

<p>Video doorbells offer an easy way to see who is at your door without having to open or even get close to the door. You'll also be able to monitor the video being recorded through the app, go through previously recorded footage, and check environmental markers like temperature. Most outdoor security cameras have an IP66 rating, which means they offer complete protection from dust ingress and can handle water jets from any direction, but shouldn't be immersed in water.</p>
