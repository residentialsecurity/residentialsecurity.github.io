<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger. The Control Panel is integrated with a touchpad or touchscreen, where the alarm can be armed and disarmed. Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
<p>There's no longer a need to sign up for expensive professional monitoring contracts—most of these systems offer free DIY monitoring as well as optional contract-free professional monitoring subscription plans that start as low as a few dollars a month. There are cameras with built-in VMD to alert security guards and improve their ability to detect and locate personnel and be alerted to activity in the scene.</p>
