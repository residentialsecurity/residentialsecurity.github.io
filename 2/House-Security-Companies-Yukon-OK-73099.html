<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. IP camera: An Internet Protocol camera generally transmits a digital signal using Internet Protocol over a network.

The video surveillance market is highly competitive, owing to strong presence of the existing vendors.</p>
<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from deterring criminals.
