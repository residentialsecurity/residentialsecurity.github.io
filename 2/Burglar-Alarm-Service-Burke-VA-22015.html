Control room operators depend on the CCTV camera images - displayed either on their work-stations or large-scale on a video wall”. The vast majority of smart CCTV systems link up to your smartphone via a specific app over Wi-Fi to share live streams of the footage. Addressing concerns about the over-reliance on cameras, Mr. Viswanathan says he does not see CCTVs as a solution to every problem.</p>
<p>Although its unfamiliar to a lot of Indians, DIY Home Security Systems are highly popular and trust worthy for millions of people in the western countries as one of the most effective and convenient security solutions. Most security companies, whether they're DIY, professionally installed, professionally monitored, or self-monitored, will offer guidance if you're confused about what to choose.</p>

<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>As for the wearable cameras, it's hard to spot them if someone is recording you. Learn how to use a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino to develop a system for monitoring and controlling your home. Use the ADT mobile app to view your security cameras through your mobile device. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with long and typically onerous contracts, and often rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage.</p>
