CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a PTZ camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>

<p>Disable monitoring for all sensors.

Most apps offer many of the same features, such as local streaming, cloud streaming, recording and storing footage locally or remotely, and motion detection and alerts.</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
