Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips.

<p>Suggestions include rotating personnel every 2 h, limit TV monitors to fewer than 10, arrange monitors in a curved configuration in front of the viewer, control the lighting over the console to avoid glare on the monitor screens or tilt the monitors if necessary, place the monitors in an order that permits easy recognition of camera locations, provide a swivel chair that hampers the opportunity for sleeping, and assign tasks to the viewer (e.g., communications and logging).</p>
<p>Covert CCTV is the practice of using video cameras in locations that are not made obvious to the persons being monitored in the specific cctv camera coverage area, but it is recommended that there is reasonable cause for the purpose of covert surveillance and that its primary objectives are clearly noted, only used for the purposes of preventing crime and are not used for longer than intended.</p>

But these very cameras can be exploited as tools for illegal surveillance and even hacking. More sophisticated behavioral rules‚Äù are under development and will appear on the market as digital CCTV equipment continues to improve.</p>
