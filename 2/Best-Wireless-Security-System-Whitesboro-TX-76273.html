Depending on the manufacturer, your home security camera will store different amounts of footage for different lengths of time.</p>
<p>Our video security and information management solution helps you build security systems that will evolve alongside your changing needs. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a PTZ camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>

For one thing, it's got major brand recognition: ADT may be the most well-known security company in the industry, and that has its advantages.
