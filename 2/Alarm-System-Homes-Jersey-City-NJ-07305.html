<p>Surveillance plays a huge part in today's society, and with cameras all around us, our day-to-day lives are experiencing higher levels of security each day. Outdoor video cameras play a very important role in law enforcement by not only capturing video of potential criminals but also by preventing crimes. They'll also send an alert to your phone when someone or something is out there, record video of the event, and depending on features, let you talk to whoever is on your property, all without ever having to open your door (or even be inside your house, for that matter).</p>
<p>In particular, CCTV allows greater flexibility in the deployment of security personnel by providing the facility whereby a single observer can remotely monitor several areas from one location.

With Security packages, certified professionals monitor your home for alarms, smoke, carbon monoxide or water leaks to notify you and emergency services as needed.</p>
