All the devices that connect with the internet, can be used by hackers to spy on you or take control of smart home functionality, for instance, or can be the target of botnets and crypto hijacking. Intrusion alarm systems may also be combined with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically record the activities of intruders, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.</p>
<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify. With rolling code technology minimizing any chance of a security breach, this is a strong indoor motion sensor helping you save money and detect any intruders in one hit.</p>

Optional equipment, including video doorbells, indoor and outdoor cameras, glass-break sensors and home automation features, are available for an additional cost. Here's a tip: You might not even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP cam or IP webcam.</p>
