The main difference between the two is that the Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera has a more robust design and is built to be weatherproof, rain or shine. This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market. Among the various criteria that impact surveillance network video recorder (NVR) system value, storage capacity can be particularly significant and easily misunderstood.</p>
<p>As long as you're willing to commit to a contract, the FrontPoint Safe Home Elite system offers a nice selection of security, home automation, and environmental components and is easy to install. The primary feature of these CCTV cameras is that they can work in low light conditions. Unless your home is already prewired for a home monitoring system, a Wi-Fi enabled security camera is much easier to install since you won't have to go into the trouble of setting up cable wires and drilling holes into your wall.</p>

<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move.

Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.

Depending on the manufacturer, your home security camera will store different amounts of footage for different lengths of time.</p>

Others like ADT and Vivint offer professionally installed systems only but typically provide their own installers. Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for every camera you install, including the Nest Hello doorbell.
