<p>Alder offers professional monitoring via a cellular network connection. Traditional security panel systems are evolving, and vendors are introducing new services - everything from door lock monitoring to temperature control and fire prevention systems. Analogue CCTV images are digitised and then passed through a series of algorithms that identify changes in the image background.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
<p>Increasing investment from the government in smart city and public security projects in the Asia Pacific region also drives the growth of the video surveillance market. Through a home security app, you can monitor your system and control wireless devices with smart home automation technology, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and IFTTT.
