This also depends on the provider, but you can anticipate signing a contract with providers who require professional installation of their systems.</p>

<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Basic units are usually just a transmitter and receiver pair, whereas higher end units can have multiple cameras on a single receiver.
