<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors. Today, the most pop recorders include an NVR (Network Video Recorder), a DVR (Digital Video Recorder), a computer (the hard drive on the computer actually), a Micro SD card, the FTP server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>You don't even have to sacrifice the camera's versatility and with its PTZ control, you can follow and record the action as it happens, when a motion alert has been triggered. Cameras and doorbells are also easy to install, but you'll have to pair them yourself. The second burglar alarm circuit using arduino is a little advanced one which uses GSM module to send SMS alerts to mobile numbers stored inside the arduino program.</p>

A digital video surveillance system is a surveillance system that captures images and videos, which can be compressed, stored, or sent over communication networks.</p>
