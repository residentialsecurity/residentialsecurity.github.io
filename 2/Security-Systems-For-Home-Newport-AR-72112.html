Many businesses and homes are now pre-wired with CAT5 cable Our 24 camera IP surveillance systems only require a CAT5 cable running from the back of our commercial grade Network Video Recorders to each IP camera on your surveillance system to network into a complete security and monitoring solution.</p>
<p>Video doorbells are the most popular security product owned (18.2%) with a professionally monitored home security system (16.2%) as 2nd most popular.
