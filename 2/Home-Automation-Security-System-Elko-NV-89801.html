<p>So, whether it is recognizing fire hazard at a warehouse or counting people at a retail store, identifying aggressive behavior (or theft) and spontaneously letting the security officer or monitoring staff performance in a hotel, hospital, or an educational institute, the IP-driven solutions have unlocked unprecedented opportunities by leveraging video analytics, which isn't possible using conventional analog-based devices.</p>
<p>You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. The advent of 360o cameras equipped with video de-warping technology is eliminating the need to deploy 3 to 4 PTZ (or the standard CCTV) cameras to cover a single region, as a single device can now effectively do the same. But Nest Aware is now a far more appealing proposition for those looking to kit their homes out with multiple security cameras.</p>
<p>Many unmonitored security systems offer self-monitored solutions. Legally, problems arise if your camera captures areas where your neighbors have an expectation of privacy (for example, if your cameras can see into their bedrooms or bathrooms) or if you use the footage for non-security purposes.
