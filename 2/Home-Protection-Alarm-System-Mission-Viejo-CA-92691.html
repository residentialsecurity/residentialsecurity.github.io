<p>The research methodology used to estimate and forecast the video surveillance market begins with capturing data on revenues of the key vendors in the market through secondary research. IP cameras are easier to install than analog cameras because they do not require a separate cable run or power boost to send images over a longer distance. This can really depend on how large the area you want to monitor is. The average home might need multiple cameras to cover the whole thing which could quickly add up to hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>Ring currently offers doorbell cameras, exterior lighting cameras, and plenty of accessories to complement their smarthome doorbells. In the following five years, the penetration of IP-based systems was quick, but most forms of cybersecurity were an afterthought. It is why more and more healthcare organizations continue to increase their use of video surveillance as part of their overall strategic security plan.</p>
