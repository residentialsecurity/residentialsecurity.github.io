<h3>Security Camera - Surveillance Camera Systems For Home And Office in Truckee CA 96161</h3>
<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from deterring criminals.

<p>Many ADT installation packages roll together equipment fees with professional installation. Most wireless systems include Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that work with a smartphone app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage.
