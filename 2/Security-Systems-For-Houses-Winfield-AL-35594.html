Security is crucial in a crisis, but smart home equipment comes in handy every single day. When you're thinking about alarm systems, you might instantly start wondering whether to go for a DIY set-up or to call in the professionals. Last but definitely not the least is Blink's very own Home Security Camera System with Motion Detection, HD Video, Battery and Cloud Storage for Smartphones.</p>
<p>Cost-effective network video recording servers. We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit because it includes all the basics (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a few extra entry sensors.

<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Nowadays, with advanced technology, you have high-quality network IP cameras available at reasonable prices.

<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that captures video at 720p will usually offer a fairly sharp picture, but 1080p video offers more detail and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it doesn't require lots of storage capacity and can be viewed on nearly all phones, tablets, and PCs.</p>
<p>For example, if you have pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensors can be adjusted or a system that can be installed in such a way that your large pets won't cause false alarms to be sent every time your pet moves.
