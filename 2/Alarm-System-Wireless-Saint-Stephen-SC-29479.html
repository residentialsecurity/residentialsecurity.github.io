<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
<p>If you want to add extras like cameras or security lighting, the up-front equipment price gets a lot steeper—but there's no company that can beat Ring's $10 a month monitoring fee. Explosion proof cameras can protect your employees from any disaster or accident beforehand, and also provide real-time support. As a bonus, most insurers provide reduced rates when home monitoring systems are installed.</p>

If you want to integrate smart home features such as smart locks , you'll need to go up to the Control tier, which costs $47.99 per month. We still think the Ring Alarm is a great option for a cheap home security system with smart home support. Some cameras can have filters installed that allow better resolution in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Some alarm systems allow you to arm and disarm from your smartphone. With smart tech, you can adjust the lights, lock doors and arm or disarm your system from anywhere through an app on your mobile device.

Today, based on the needs of an individual's need, people can buy different types of CCTV camera.</p>
<p>Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches. Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>

<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Security lights are very useful to scare the intruders especially if these lights are employed in the compound or on the roof tops. You can choose from our Expert Approved security DVR recorder , and IP camera NVR , or Tribrid DVR that's perfect for you, as well as our many CCTV cameras and accessories to configure the perfect system for your needs. Once the specific balance of video data quantity, quality, and archiving required for a given security application is determined, it's easy to estimate the amount of storage capacity an NVR system must include.</p>
