<p>So you've got a ClickHouse DB, and you're looking for a tool to monitor it. You've come to the right place. Smart technology provides that control, it means you can manage everything from making sure you didn't forget to set the alarm to checking if the kids got home from school okay - all from your mobile device whilst you're out and about. With our CCTV cameras, you will now be able to detect any changes in behaviour, however insignificant. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>
<p>Some systems store recorded video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others offer cloud storage. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras only from certain manufacturers and not others. To maintain its leadership position in the video surveillance market, the company is focusing on investing in products and solutions related to the security business.</p>
