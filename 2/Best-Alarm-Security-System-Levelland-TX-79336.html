Software is used on the local PC that allows access to the digital video recorder. More high-end equipment packages—like the ones Vivint Smart Home provides—come with a touch-screen control panel and the option to add outdoor home security cameras, all of which require professional installation.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>
