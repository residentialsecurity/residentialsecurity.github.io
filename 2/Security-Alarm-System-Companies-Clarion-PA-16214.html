The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera equipment. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>
<p>Some systems store recorded video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others offer cloud storage.
