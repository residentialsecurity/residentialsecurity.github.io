<p>Keep an eye on your home with home alert systems that remotely monitor and control your home, vacation property or small business. By pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Another type of home security controller, the all-in-one, is actually a security camera that usually contains several wireless radios, motion and sound sensors, and a siren designed to scare off uninvited guests and warn you of an intrusion.</p>
<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
<p>For this reason, some cameras can also run for a short time on battery power. These types of cameras typically use rechargeable batteries that can be easily popped out and taken indoors for charging with a USB cable, but they tend to drain quickly in colder weather. Like all Nest devices, you can control your Nest Secure home system through the Nest app. Your control panel registers an emergency event and sends a signal to the central monitoring station, where the appropriate authorities are notified and sent to your home.</p>
