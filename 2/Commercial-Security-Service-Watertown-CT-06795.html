In broad terms, advanced video-based surveillance could be described as an intelligent video processing technique designed to assist security personnel's by providing reliable real-time alerts and to support efficient video analysis for forensic investigations.</p>
<p>Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver.

Another important section of the report is the competitive analysis of the global CCTV Camera market. Deeper home security systems include surveillance cameras inside and in the garden, smoke detectors, water detectors and various audible alarms and floodlighting.</p>

The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
