Typically, a CCTV security system with 4 dome cameras, 4 channel DVR with 1 TB hard disk costs around 15k to 20k depending on factors like where are you living, CCTV and the length of wire.

<p>Important thing to note here is that in Window Sensor, current is always passing until there is a breakage in glass of a window.

Nest uses the same home alarm monitoring centers as Brinks, but the service comes with a lower monthly cost.</p>

The video surveillance market is highly competitive, owing to strong presence of the existing vendors.</p>
