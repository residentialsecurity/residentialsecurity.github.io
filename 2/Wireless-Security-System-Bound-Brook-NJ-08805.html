<p>CCTV cameras system recorders: DVR (digital video recorder) which record onto hard drives is the best option. For doors and windows switches are provided which are open as long as the door or window is closed, but which, on being released by opening the door or windows, automatically close the circuit. Of these criteria, one of the most important in aviation security is the overall resolution of the image along with its field of view.</p>
