According to a recent report by Mordor Intelligence, the video surveillance market was valued at $29.98 billion in 2016, and is expected to reach a value of $72.19 billion by 2022. DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well.</p>
<p>We'll show you how a video surveillance system can help your business reduce loss, document events, improve employee safety, and gain visibility into your operations. They have indoor, outdoor, and doorbell camera options and advanced smart home capabilities. In case of a power loss, the back-up battery will activate to maintain your intruder alarm protection for several hours.</p>

<p>You can configure each of the wireless modules for a specific purpose and in return trigger specific alarms as per the need. In addition, many CCTV cameras even have night vision capabilities that allow a CCTV camera to view and record low light images using special technology. While Brinks offers only month-to-month or 36-month contracts, its home security systems come with a 30-day trial and a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>The remote control is one of the features of this home security system so that you can arm and disarm the alarms with the keychain or the app. Keep in mind though, Vivint is not a DIY system — it does require professional installation. Police response times are 85% faster when an alarm is verified by your security company. CCTV cameras were not ubiquitous, even about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Google is also adding a bunch of new smarts to Nest Aware, including the ability to monitor your home using audio picked up by Nest smart speakers, so that a smoke alarm or glass-breaking sound will send an alert to the Google Home app. Computers are used on the network to store the cctv camera images but with the flexibility of IP CCTV, the cctv cameras could be located on opposite sides of the world.</p>

In order to detect such entry, these alarm systems require that each point of entry (hood, trunk door) have associated therewith a switch (including in some cases a light activated by the switch) which would cause current to be drawn from the battery when the point of entry was accessed.</p>
<p>With a special feature of motion capture, any movement in front of the camera would be detected and the footage along with photos sent both to the house owners and also to the police, following which the police patrol teams would be directed to the house. And some cameras have special features that go beyond those basics. Hikvision's development of an AI cloud software platform and its adoption will promote the growth of IoT as well as advance the integration of IoT with information networks; it will also help develop the company's Big Data business.</p>

<p>Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
