IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
<p>It sounds fancy and sophisticated, but Remote Control is a home security feature that comes with many affordable systems. And some security cameras, like Reolink Argus 2 , have an SD card slot, which allows you to have the option to put into your own Micro SD card for motion event recording.
