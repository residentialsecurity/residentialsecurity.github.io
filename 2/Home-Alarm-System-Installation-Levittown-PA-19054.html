<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>3 Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours. However, during night time and in poorly lit areas infrared or thermal cameras are used that gives black and white images.

Depending on the shape and size, you have different types of CCTV cameras classified as box camera, dome camera, bullet camera, board camera, and hidden camera. A VIP system consists of a video camera (a digitiser in the case of analogue cameras) and a microprocessor for processing the digital-image - and software to interpret the image content and extract detection information from it.</p>
