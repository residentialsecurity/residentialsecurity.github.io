<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? They sell high-decibel alarm systems that are compatible with video cameras, environmental monitoring, home automation and voice control. Our security specialists can provide and install monitored, wireless, or remote alarm systems for houses and businesses across the South East region. Some small retailers selling unbranded cameras may only offer a statutory six month product guarantee at best, which you might find yourself fighting for, if the camera fails within that time frame.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats.

Because of the home automation feature, you have the option to install the Frontpoint app and gain remote control over your security system, alarm history and visitor activity.</p>

In the past, we've seen cameras as low as $45, while security systems range between $100 and $150. Equipment includes things like your door and window sensors, motion sensors, control panel, etc. A well-designed and efficient CCTV infrastructure placement within your business premise can provide 100% security coverage.</p>
