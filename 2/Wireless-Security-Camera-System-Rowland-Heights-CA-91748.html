<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. DIY monitoring is always available with the free SimpliSafe mobile app. Many security cameras have infrared (IR) light technology, which aids in motion detection and enables the cameras to function in low light. However, in terms of market share, the commercial sector dominates the global CCTV camera market The commercial segment is expected to reach a market size of over US$ 13,100 Mn by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The ownership of the CCTV cameras and broadband network will remain with the BSNL. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for security applications such as video surveillance to monitor and record borders, ports, transportation infrastructure, corporate houses, educational institutes, public places, buildings, and others. Plus, the base is compatible with a range of cameras and motion sensors, so you can expand your home security system in the future.</p>
