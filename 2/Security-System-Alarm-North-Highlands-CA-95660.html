The system is also subject to false alarms resulting from automobile headlights, lightning flashes and so forth, entering the receiver.

Siren Several one-box systems like Canary and Somfy come with a very loud built-in siren that should hopefully scare off intruders (or next door's cat).</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
