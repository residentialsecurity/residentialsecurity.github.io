And the recording won't mess up with your network, because they have their proprietary network to transmit the video, which means the video recording won't ”eat up” your bandwidths.

<p>In some cases, the salespeople use high-pressure or deceptive sales tactics to get potential customers to buy expensive, and sometimes substandard, systems or equipment they don't need.
