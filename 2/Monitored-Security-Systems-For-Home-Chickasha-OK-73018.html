<p>This convenient storage allows you to access your clips at any time from your home's control panel, the Vivint Smart Home app , or your online account.

To make sure these are as discreet as possible, installation is normally carried out by an alarm company, however, some DIY options are available. Brinks has pretty standard equipment, but we love its smart monitoring alerts.</p>
