<p>Both monitored and unmonitored home security systems usually include a mobile app. Ring's indoor and outdoor video camera surveillance system has no required monthly fees. Almost without exception, you'll now be able to use your favorite digital assistant to add voice control to your smart home security. If you're a Google Home owner, if you want a more attractive-looking system, or if you just don't want to put security in the hands of Amazon (Ring's parent company), SimpliSafe is a flexible, affordable, and easy-to-use live-monitoring security option.</p>

<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The EufyCam 2C is an impressive wireless home security camera system that offers a great range of features for a very affordable price. Also, Argus 2 and the other Reolink battery-powered security cameras won't work with any third-party storage options. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>
