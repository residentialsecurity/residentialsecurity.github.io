In most cases, customers can also check the app to view live footage from security cameras. When the circuit is broken, the Control Panel will either sound an audible alarm or alert the security company - in some cases, both.</p>
<p>We appreciate how ADT's Command panel (available in the Control package and higher) doubles as a Z-wave smart home hub, so you can configure compatible devices from other manufacturers. These cctv cameras are generally connected directly to a computer or a computer network and are accessed by software to enable the live viewing, recording and playback of the video images.</p>

Depending on how your system is set up, one of two things will happen-either a high-decibel alarm will sound or a silent alarm will be sent to your ADT monitoring station.</p>
<p>You can also use the app to control and pinch to zoom the camera up to four times. This is the foundation of any interactive monitoring home security system. 145 years ago, we invented security and alarm monitoring services. Frontpoint Security offers a simple and smart monitored home security service, using a wide range of different wireless devices.
