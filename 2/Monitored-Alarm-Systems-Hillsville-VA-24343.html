They sell high-decibel alarm systems that are compatible with video cameras, environmental monitoring, home automation and voice control. Our security specialists can provide and install monitored, wireless, or remote alarm systems for houses and businesses across the South East region. Some small retailers selling unbranded cameras may only offer a statutory six month product guarantee at best, which you might find yourself fighting for, if the camera fails within that time frame.</p>
<p>You don't even have to sacrifice the camera's versatility and with its PTZ control, you can follow and record the action as it happens, when a motion alert has been triggered. Cameras and doorbells are also easy to install, but you'll have to pair them yourself. The second burglar alarm circuit using arduino is a little advanced one which uses GSM module to send SMS alerts to mobile numbers stored inside the arduino program.</p>
