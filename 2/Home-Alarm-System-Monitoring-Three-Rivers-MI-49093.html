<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. Moreover, cameras can be placed in areas that require security such as parking spots, VIP areas, schools, restaurants & hotels, bank locker rooms, hospitals, etc.</p>

If you want to remotely record a security camera, you can try to set up the recording to an FTP server. Now, considering an interception of the light beam by an intruder, it is found that the voltage of the output of cells 9 and 10 will be variable.</p>
