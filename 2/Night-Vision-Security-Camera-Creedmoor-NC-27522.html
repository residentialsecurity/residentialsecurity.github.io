DIY security systems are perfect for pretty much any living situation, including rental houses and apartments. This includes access to the ADT Pulse smartphone app, which is available for iOS and Android This doesn't work with smart home voice systems like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, though.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems.
