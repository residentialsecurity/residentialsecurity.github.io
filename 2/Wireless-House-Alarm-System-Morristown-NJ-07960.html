<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>PTZ cameras should be used throughout the public and sterile areas to monitor passenger movements. View high-quality video of your business day or night, including in low-light conditions. Most of the best indoor cameras connect using WiFi while some while use Z-Wave or Zigbee.

<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.
