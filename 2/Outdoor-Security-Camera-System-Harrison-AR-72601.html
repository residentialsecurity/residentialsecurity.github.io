<p>Many top security system companies may also offer environmental sensors, such as temperature and humidity sensors for fire and flood detection, smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors to monitor indoor air quality in real time.

<p>Several CCTV cameras can be integrated into your smart home, linking up with tech such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa.
