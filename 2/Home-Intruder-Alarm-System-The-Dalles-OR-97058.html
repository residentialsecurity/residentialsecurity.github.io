However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>

Although IP Cctv Cameras can be connected directly to an existing network, bandwidth is always a consideration as the data sent from the cctv camera is likely to be much larger than standard data transferred over usual office networks which if not planned correctly can slow down the entire network.

<p>In Wireless Systems , the principle is the same except no wires are required to connect the sensor to the Control Unit. With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone. You can monitor these systems yourself using a mobile app, but many DIY companies also offer flexible, no-contract professional monitoring plans.</p>
