<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. The system can be armed or disarmed using wireless remote control that can also be used as panic switch to alert neighbors in case of medical emergency or physical attacks or robberies. If you are associated with explosion sensitive & hazardous industry based in regions such as Dubai, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar or Oman, then SharpEagle Technology can help you with your requirements pertaining to explosion-proof CCTV cameras.</p>

Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and select your notification settings. When the monitoring station receives an alarm signal they can ring though to the premises, which in turn will switch the microphones on and allow them to listen quickly to any activity.</p>
