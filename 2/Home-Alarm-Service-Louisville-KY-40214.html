<p>The Smart Home Video Monitoring plan adds intelligent assistance for complete home monitoring with smart video cameras. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. Within five years, industry watchers say, remote monitoring systems will be standard add-ons to your cable or phone service. Wireless CCTV cameras were created to minimise installation time They also make the appearance of the camera much tidier, which may be an important factor for locations such as churches, museums or stately homes.</p>

IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>

Run the software that came with your camera to set a password for the camera, and to see the IP address your router has assigned it.
