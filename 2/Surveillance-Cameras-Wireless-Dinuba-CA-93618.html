<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. That's especially true if you've already sunk money into other Nest gear like the thermostat or cameras Instead of getting a separate security system, you can get one that syncs with your current equipment and uses the same app you're already used to. The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time.
