<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras over fixed access points are often tied directly to the ACS. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data. Stay connected to your ADT home security system and smart home devices on the go with your favorite mobile device.
