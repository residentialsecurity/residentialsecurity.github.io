<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Lyman</h3>
<p>Video surveillance camera vendors, who have access to extensive technical and financial resources are anticipated to gain a competitive edge over their rivals, as they have the capacity to cater to the global market requirements. Those who buy burglar alarms are investing in protection; they want their security system to reduce the risk of a crime being committed against their property.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
<p>In addition to burglar alarms, popular home security equipment includes surveillance cameras, window and door sensors, glass-break detectors and motion sensors. Madurai City Police have launched a ‘Locked House Monitoring System' (LHMS), under which the city police will install temporary CCTV cameras free of cost in the houses whenever the residents go out of town.</p>
