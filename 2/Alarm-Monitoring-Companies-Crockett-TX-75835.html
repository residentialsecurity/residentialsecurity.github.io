<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The main difference between the two is that the Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera has a more robust design and is built to be weatherproof, rain or shine. This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market. Among the various criteria that impact surveillance network video recorder (NVR) system value, storage capacity can be particularly significant and easily misunderstood.</p>
<p>Working with customers and partners, Senstar can adapt solutions with the most appropriate technology to address the level of security required and budget available. IP cameras feature digital image sensors with high image resolutions, onboard web server, DVR storage, video analytics, Dual Image Sensor, Power over Ethernet Connectivity, and low power operation making it suitable for remote industrial video surveillance.</p>
