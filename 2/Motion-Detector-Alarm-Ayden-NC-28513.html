<p>Low-light-level cameras provide the means to view outside when very little light is available. However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Many security systems are wireless and easy to install, but companies that offer DIY installation also offer installation guidance through customer support and online guides, so you're never alone.</p>
<p>The company is fairly new to the security camera market having released its SimpliCam in mid-2017.

<p>Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection.

The worldwide retail sales of CCTV cameras is increasing significantly every year.</p>
