Launching the project at Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, Kejriwal said over 1,000 Delhi government schools will be equipped with CCTV cameras by November this year. So we mounted the sensors and set up a few security cameras, along with a video doorbell camera to see how well it secured our home.</p>
<p>When Genetec first introduced the ability to encrypt video data in transit and at rest in 2016, the physical security industry saw it as an important innovation for protecting confidentiality in physical security systems. Another helpful aspect of adding advanced technology to your security system is that key components such as smart doorbells and security cameras can be synched to work together.</p>
<p>The research methodology used to estimate and forecast the video surveillance market begins with capturing data on revenues of the key vendors in the market through secondary research. IP cameras are easier to install than analog cameras because they do not require a separate cable run or power boost to send images over a longer distance. This can really depend on how large the area you want to monitor is. The average home might need multiple cameras to cover the whole thing which could quickly add up to hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>Despite protests and legal complaints, the government has equipped the capital city with 100,000 cameras linked to artificial intelligence (AI).While it was reported that the technology might prove to be inept in identifying individuals wearing medical masks, a China-based company has underlined that the facial tracking solution can also identify those who are wearing masks.</p>

If it notices something that is out of the ordinary, which is usually when someone is attempting to do mischief with your smart devices such as smart cameras or smart thermostat, Akita will detect the incoming packets of traffic on the network for intrusion attempts and block access before notifying you.</p>
