<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>Vivint's monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty penny. The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips. There are three types of cameras based on lighting and resolution. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
<p>Internet protocol (IP) surveillance is a digitalized and networked version of CCTV system, which is rapidly becoming the most flexible and future-proof option for security and surveillance systems. A potentiometer is an adjustable resistor which is used for applications such as a volume adjuster on some control panels and a sensitivity adjustment on shock sensors.</p>
