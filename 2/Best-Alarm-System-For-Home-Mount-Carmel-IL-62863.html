The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>Vivint makes cutting-edge security cameras for indoor and outdoor use. It is common for companies to charge a separate fee for monitoring services.

With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone. You can monitor these systems yourself using a mobile app, but many DIY companies also offer flexible, no-contract professional monitoring plans.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
