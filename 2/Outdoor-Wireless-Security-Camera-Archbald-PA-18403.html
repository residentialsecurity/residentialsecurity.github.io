<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. In case of analog cameras, an encoder must be installed to transmit analog video over IP. The input from an analog camera is encoded and output a digital stream for transmission over an IP network. DIY security systems are perfect for pretty much any living situation, including rental houses and apartments. This includes access to the ADT Pulse smartphone app, which is available for iOS and Android This doesn't work with smart home voice systems like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, though.</p>

For example, Simplisafe features high-quality DIY (no tools required!) security equipment with a wide variety of plans, plenty of add-on equipment options, and no contract requirements.</p>

<p>It's one of the best systems we've tested, with customizable alarm triggers and consistent monitoring response times. These cameras share the images across the internet, so CCTV footage can be easily accessed. The company specializes in 100% wireless systems able to be controlled through the company's mobile app. Cameras that capture 4K (Ultra HD) video are also available, but you'll need a very strong network connection to stream it without experiencing choppiness or lag, and you'll need lots of room to store recorded video, which may result in expensive cloud storage fees.</p>
<p>Smart device integration: If you have a home full of smart devices, consider looking for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that includes a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or—eventually a Thread—radio that can connect them. You have different types of CCTV cameras based on the location.

<p>Several CCTV cameras can be integrated into your smart home, linking up with tech such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Most of the sensors detect opening of a door, window or breakage of glass or movement of human beings. Then, when the light beam is intercepted, the grid voltage is permitted to go to a high negative value, thereby cutting off the plate current and operating the alarm or indicator relay.</p>
