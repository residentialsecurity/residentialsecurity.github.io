<p>Cost-effective network video recording servers. We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit because it includes all the basics (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a few extra entry sensors. The timer is connected with a set of components to switch the laser light at certain frequency. The Google Nest Secure alarm system is priced at $399 and includes basic equipment like Nest Guard, Nest Detect, a Nest Tag and the Nest App.</p>

We don't need sophisticated micro controllers like 8051 to build a very simple burglar alarm circuit with minimal features.</p>
<p>Many IP cameras have a built-in SD card.

The State Government has already decided to install CCTV-based City Surveillance and Intelligent Traffic Management System in major cities of Gujarat to monitor the traffic in sensitive areas, for which tenders have been floated.</p>
<p>The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
