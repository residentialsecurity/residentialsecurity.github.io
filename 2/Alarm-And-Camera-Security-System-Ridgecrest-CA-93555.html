<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>
