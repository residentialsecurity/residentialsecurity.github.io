<p>So you've got a ClickHouse DB, and you're looking for a tool to monitor it. You've come to the right place. Smart technology provides that control, it means you can manage everything from making sure you didn't forget to set the alarm to checking if the kids got home from school okay - all from your mobile device whilst you're out and about. With our CCTV cameras, you will now be able to detect any changes in behaviour, however insignificant. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>
<p>Basic units are usually just a transmitter and receiver pair, whereas higher end units can have multiple cameras on a single receiver. The Ministry of Railways has also initiated installation of CCTV cameras in 983 railway stations and train coaches for which funding is partly using the Nirbhaya Fund, as per a Lok Sabha answer in June 2019.
