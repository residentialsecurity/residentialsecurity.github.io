<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Nowadays, with advanced technology, you have high-quality network IP cameras available at reasonable prices. When your alarm goes off, two indicators within the house, such as a door contact and a motion sensor, must both have been triggered to warrant police call-out. Matrix brings you centralized security with IP Video Surveillance solutions that can manage multiple devices located at multiple locations.</p>
<p>The key players profiled in the video surveillance industry include HKVISION, Ltd., Bosch Security System, Honeywell Security Group, Dahua Technology, FLIR, Panasonic, Avigilon, Axis Communication, Infinova, and Pelco. For example, Simplisafe features high-quality DIY (no tools required!) security equipment with a wide variety of plans, plenty of add-on equipment options, and no contract requirements.</p>
