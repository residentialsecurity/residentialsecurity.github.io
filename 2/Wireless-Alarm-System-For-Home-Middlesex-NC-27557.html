<p>But a wireless security camera system may probably be one of the most beneficial of all components for your house. In this article, we'll take a look at 10 different types of security cameras and what they're best suited for. Monitored home security systems are generally more expensive than unmonitored systems, but they have the added security benefit of connecting directly to a professional monitoring center.</p>

Founded in 1999, Vivint has positioned itself as a next generation home security services provider with an emphasis on home automation and integration with smart home devices.</p>
