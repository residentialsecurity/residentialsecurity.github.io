<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? They sell high-decibel alarm systems that are compatible with video cameras, environmental monitoring, home automation and voice control. Our security specialists can provide and install monitored, wireless, or remote alarm systems for houses and businesses across the South East region. Some small retailers selling unbranded cameras may only offer a statutory six month product guarantee at best, which you might find yourself fighting for, if the camera fails within that time frame.</p>
<p>ADT Blue is a camera-heavy, DIY version of the ADT system, and we like its cameras much better than the traditional‚Äù ADT versions.

Hybrid digital video recorders (HDVRs) support IP cameras. Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the best features on the market, including video analytics and 4K image sensors (as well as more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
<p>Many systems offer options for centralized control from a smartphone, so homeowners can control the security system remotely. In the past, we've seen cameras as low as $45, while security systems range between $100 and $150.

When you place a security company's sticker in a front window and plant their sign in your front yard, you are telling burglars you home is professionally protected and not a wise choice for an attempted burglary.</p>
<p>This convenient storage allows you to access your clips at any time from your home's control panel, the Vivint Smart Home app , or your online account. Although not readily available in many remote home monitoring systems, a camera with this feature can receive sound, usually via a microphone, emitting sound through a speaker, or both. In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void.</p>
