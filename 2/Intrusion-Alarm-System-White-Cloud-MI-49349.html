Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>

See the benefits of enabling edge-based storage in VSaaS applications and the value proposition of Micron's surveillance-grade edge storage solutions.
