These sensors detect infrared energy, enabling them to detect dramatic increases of heat in a room - such as would occur when a burglar enters an otherwise empty room.</p>

And some security cameras, like Reolink Argus 2 , have an SD card slot, which allows you to have the option to put into your own Micro SD card for motion event recording. Sensors If you don't want a camera in every room you should install a motion detector (at least in the hallways) that can send alerts and set of an alarm.</p>
