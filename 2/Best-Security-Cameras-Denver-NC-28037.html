<p>Our video security and information management solution helps you build security systems that will evolve alongside your changing needs. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a PTZ camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>We'll never sell you standard off-the-shelf intruder alarms. It's the ideal choice if you have a security guard who is monitoring a live video feed on site.

The young man who was the culprit fled and the police was stymied because the building had not set up any cameras in the basement, so there was no record of the crime to help the investigation.</p>

Hello Rupe, we are sorry that you cannot record Reolink cameras to your own web server or cloud since our cameras don't support such network protocols.
