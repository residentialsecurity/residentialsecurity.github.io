<h2>Camera Home Security System Tonawanda New York</h2>
<p>Wireless home security system: Wireless home alarm systems utilize a series of battery-powered sensors to alert homeowners of potential intrusions. If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address. Varifocal cameras allow you to adjust the focal length, the angle and increase or decrease the zoom - ideal for obtaining footage in a square room where you would normally experience a ‘dead zone' with any alternative, fixed lense camera.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
