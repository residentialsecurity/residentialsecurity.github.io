<p>So you've got a ClickHouse DB, and you're looking for a tool to monitor it. You've come to the right place. Smart technology provides that control, it means you can manage everything from making sure you didn't forget to set the alarm to checking if the kids got home from school okay - all from your mobile device whilst you're out and about. With our CCTV cameras, you will now be able to detect any changes in behaviour, however insignificant. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>
<p>The camera also has a night vision feature but just like daytime video recording, footages taken at night look a little underpowered. Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and select your notification settings. When the monitoring station receives an alarm signal they can ring though to the premises, which in turn will switch the microphones on and allow them to listen quickly to any activity.</p>
