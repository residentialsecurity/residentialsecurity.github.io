<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Pawleys Island</h3>
<p>Via sensors and contacts, they detect movement or the opening of doors and windows, after which a loud alarm is produced to alert those nearby of the unauthorised entry. Huawei, through its chip-making subsidiary HiSilicon, is powering tens of millions of low-cost video surveillance devices used in the Western market. Past statistics on crimes show that the more noticeable and better technology the camera systems are, the more it helps in preventing criminal activities in business or residential buildings 6 Factors that are necessary for an outdoor camera are: they should be weather- resistant, and should include night vision even in well-lit locations.</p>
<p>If unauthorized entry to the engine compartment (or trunk) occurs, line 36 goes to a logic high level and sets flip-flop 74. The output of flip-flop 74 is directly connected to a second input of OR gate 90. This instantly activates sounding timer 92 and the alarm is sounded for two minutes until reset due to the action of one shot 94, as described above.</p>
<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
