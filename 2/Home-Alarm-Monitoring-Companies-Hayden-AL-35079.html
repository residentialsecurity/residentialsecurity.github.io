A VIP system consists of a video camera (a digitiser in the case of analogue cameras) and a microprocessor for processing the digital-image - and software to interpret the image content and extract detection information from it.</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify. With rolling code technology minimizing any chance of a security breach, this is a strong indoor motion sensor helping you save money and detect any intruders in one hit.</p>
