<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>

<p>Google is also adding a bunch of new smarts to Nest Aware, including the ability to monitor your home using audio picked up by Nest smart speakers, so that a smoke alarm or glass-breaking sound will send an alert to the Google Home app. Computers are used on the network to store the cctv camera images but with the flexibility of IP CCTV, the cctv cameras could be located on opposite sides of the world.</p>
