<p>Advantages: low rate of false alarms, very reliable sensors, and high rate of detection. App design: Many of these home security cameras connect to apps and use them for setup. Compression: Compression is used to eliminate unnecessary data from the footage transmitted to your video recorder, thereby saving space.

<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
<p>Our remote monitoring operators then use all available resources to investigate the cause of the alarm. The amount and quality of data stored on storage media is subject to compression ratios, images stored per second, image size and is effected by the retention period of the videos or images.
