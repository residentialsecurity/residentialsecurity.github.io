<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors. Today, the most pop recorders include an NVR (Network Video Recorder), a DVR (Digital Video Recorder), a computer (the hard drive on the computer actually), a Micro SD card, the FTP server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. There are plenty of affordable cameras available that offer good video performance, but as with just about any smart device, you'll pay more for features such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connectivity, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage options, and rechargeable battery power.</p>
