<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>According to the market analysis, the residential segment is expected to grow at a CAGR 17.8% during the forecast period, which is the highest among all other end users of CCTV cameras. Driveway alarms can also be purchased in hard-wired and wireless systems. Another aspect of consideration is the development of energy-efficient devices for long-term monitoring and portable applications.</p>

Monitoring fees begin at $29, and equipment costs range from $299 to $499. Whether you need a widespread system that can cover multiple locations or just a few cameras to watch your storefront, there's a solution for everyone.</p>
