<h4>Intrusion Alarm System Cypress 77429</h4>
<p>Our approach is to begin with a wide-angle view, and then zoom in to cover the features, benefits, and details of a home security system.

Digital video surveillance systems are based on digital cameras that send video or still images through a local area network (LAN) to a server.</p>
<p>Once it's installed, you'll get alerts whenever the camera's motion sensors goes off, and you can see who's at your door and talk to them through the camera mic. Some add Bluetooth for local control and easier setup through your smartphone, while others incorporate separate home automation networking standards to interact with other devices, like Zigbee or Z-Wave.</p>
<p>All of the systems we've tested feature an app that lets you use your smartphone as your command center to arm and disarm the system, create rules, add and delete components, and receive push notifications when alarms are triggered. If it notices something that is out of the ordinary, which is usually when someone is attempting to do mischief with your smart devices such as smart cameras or smart thermostat, Akita will detect the incoming packets of traffic on the network for intrusion attempts and block access before notifying you.</p>
