<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app ‘EZVIZ' by the house owners. Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>
<p>Driven by video analytics, CCTV cameras are able to zoom in to reveal the identity of an individual - intruder and guest - that is highly beneficial to prevent crimes when utilized properly. If you want to remotely record a security camera, you can try to set up the recording to an FTP server.
