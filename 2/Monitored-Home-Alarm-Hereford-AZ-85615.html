Step 4 - If you have any smart home devices, you'll need to follow the specific instructions for setup to ensure that they function properly with your security system.</p>

<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process.

Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
