<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The EufyCam 2C is an impressive wireless home security camera system that offers a great range of features for a very affordable price. Also, Argus 2 and the other Reolink battery-powered security cameras won't work with any third-party storage options. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.</p>
