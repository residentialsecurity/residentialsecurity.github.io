<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>DIY installation with self-monitoring: Some brands we recommend, like Ring, Abode, and Nest, offer both professional and self-monitoring. Others like ADT and Vivint offer professionally installed systems only but typically provide their own installers. Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for every camera you install, including the Nest Hello doorbell. In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm.</p>

A Digital Video Recorder (DVR) or a Network Video Recorder (NVR) system provides evidence of whatever set off the alarm in the first place.
