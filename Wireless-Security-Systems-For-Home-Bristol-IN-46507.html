<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. Moreover, cameras can be placed in areas that require security such as parking spots, VIP areas, schools, restaurants & hotels, bank locker rooms, hospitals, etc.</p>

If you think you're satisfied with the cloud services, you can go for the optional monthly plans which provide extended cloud storage at a fraction of the cost of traditional home monitoring systems. This started to change in 2010 with the adoption of the H.264 codec and the introduction of the first megapixel cameras, which provided better video resolution for a similar cost.</p>
