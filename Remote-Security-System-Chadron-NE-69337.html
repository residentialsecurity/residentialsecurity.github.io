<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Driven by video analytics, CCTV cameras are able to zoom in to reveal the identity of an individual - intruder and guest - that is highly beneficial to prevent crimes when utilized properly. If you want to remotely record a security camera, you can try to set up the recording to an FTP server. Now, considering an interception of the light beam by an intruder, it is found that the voltage of the output of cells 9 and 10 will be variable.</p>
