<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>Vivint makes cutting-edge security cameras for indoor and outdoor use. It is common for companies to charge a separate fee for monitoring services. Most of today's home security systems will offer some degree of smart home integration and it's a worthwhile add-on or enhancement for more complete control of many working parts of the home. Join up surveillance efforts and quickly analyze data to deliver timely monitoring and surveillance across your security landscape.</p>
