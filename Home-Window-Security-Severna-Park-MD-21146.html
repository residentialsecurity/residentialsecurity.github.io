Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment. You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>3 Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours. However, during night time and in poorly lit areas infrared or thermal cameras are used that gives black and white images. Trial monitoring can be built into people's roles so they do not do this full time.</p>

<p>You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office.
