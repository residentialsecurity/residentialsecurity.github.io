<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips.
