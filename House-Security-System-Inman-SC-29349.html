<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger. The Control Panel is integrated with a touchpad or touchscreen, where the alarm can be armed and disarmed. Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
<p>Just as a suggestion and maybe useful tip, if you are actually working with more than one or two cameras, you might want to set up a surveillance spot or hub, the central point or your hole security operation, you for sure will want to keep everything in one place, that will guarantee easy access and a lot of comforts when you are setting up everything.</p>

Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision.
