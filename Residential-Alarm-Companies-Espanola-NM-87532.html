<p>You need specific video recording equipment such as camcorders and monitors to record, view, and store the footage. With remote -sensing technology, further strengthened by state-of-the-art ergonomics, you are given the true value for the money on the purchase of the burglar alarms. Some of the best affordable home security companies offer hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The output of discharge comparator 40 is connected to a first input of an OR gate 76. The output of OR gate 76 is connected to the set input of flip-flop 72. Thus, once the system is armed, any discharge of current which causes a sufficient drop across battery cable 24 to change the state of discharge comparator 40 produces an output which is supplied to the set input of flip-flop 72.</p>
