While IC Realtime offers cloud-based analytics that can upgrade existing, dumb cameras, other companies are building artificial intelligence directly into their hardware. Keep in mind that surveillance is often understood most of the times as a violation of your privacy, a lot of activists are against surveillance systems in homes and private locations, and likely are establishing that surveillance is only good in public spaces where public safety can be at risk.</p>

With ADT home security packages, you get more than just a smart security system. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks.
