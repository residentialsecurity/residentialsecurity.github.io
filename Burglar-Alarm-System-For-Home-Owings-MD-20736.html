The indoor video camera comes with full 1080p HD video recording as well as two-way audio. It's the ideal choice for a security guard to monitor live video feed on site. A fully programmable environmental monitoring system, the Sensaphone 800 allows both local and remote monitoring and control of your home or small business. These are the premium packages you see that cost upwards of $350-$700 for the equipment and around $40-$60 per month for monitoring.</p>
<p>PTZ cameras should be used throughout the public and sterile areas to monitor passenger movements. View high-quality video of your business day or night, including in low-light conditions.

<p>A smart TV, media players connected to the TV, smart lights, smart appliances, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, smart displays such as Amazon Echo Show and Google Nest Hub, smart cameras, a water purifier or air purifier that connects with the internet and so on. The thing is, none of these smart devices have any security built in. That is where Akita steps in and adds a layer that analyses the data packets being to and from these smart devices on your network—and immediately raises an alarm if something is amiss.</p>
