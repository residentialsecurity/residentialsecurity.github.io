<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately. Usually, they are black and white cameras that do not have very high resolution. Real-time alarm notifications, sirens, video recording, and easy viewing make it one of the best home security systems in the Indian market.</p>

Launching the project at Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, Kejriwal said over 1,000 Delhi government schools will be equipped with CCTV cameras by November this year. So we mounted the sensors and set up a few security cameras, along with a video doorbell camera to see how well it secured our home.</p>
<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
