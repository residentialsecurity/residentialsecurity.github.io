<p>Nearly all DIY systems can be self-monitored using a mobile app that allows you to arm and disarm the system remotely, monitor sensor status, and view live and recorded video. Typically, you will find major components such as a control panel, alarm, sensors, and detectors in a security system.

<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
