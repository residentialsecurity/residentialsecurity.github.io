<p>Both analog and IP cameras use CCDs, and the number of pixels across their horizontal and vertical dimensions is an important factor in determining image resolution. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarmâ€”if they respond at all.</p>

Archive footage is stored on network video recorders (NVRs) or on secure software for later access. They will also know how to maintain their own systems and prevent or lessen false alarms.
