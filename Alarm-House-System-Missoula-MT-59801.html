However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all.</p>

Archive footage is stored on network video recorders (NVRs) or on secure software for later access. They will also know how to maintain their own systems and prevent or lessen false alarms.
