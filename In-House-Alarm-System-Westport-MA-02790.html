That's a nice change from systems like Vivint Smart Home, which only works with its own components.</p>
<p>At the cheaper end of the smart security camera market, I wasn't expecting big things from the BT Smart Camera.

<p>It sounds fancy and sophisticated, but Remote Control is a home security feature that comes with many affordable systems.

Sensors If you don't want a camera in every room you should install a motion detector (at least in the hallways) that can send alerts and set of an alarm.</p>
