<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. But just like Netgear, they've also ventured into digital home solutions, specifically remote home monitoring systems. An alert's processing time, or response time,” can depend on the system setup, monitoring center technology, staff training, and other factors. The system also integrates with smart home devices from other manufacturers, including Arlo home security cameras and the August Smart Lock Pro These can be installed at the same time as the system or added in later on. That's a nice change from systems like Vivint Smart Home, which only works with its own components.</p>
