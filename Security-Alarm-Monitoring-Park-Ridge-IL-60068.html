<p>Via sensors and contacts, they detect movement or the opening of doors and windows, after which a loud alarm is produced to alert those nearby of the unauthorised entry. Huawei, through its chip-making subsidiary HiSilicon, is powering tens of millions of low-cost video surveillance devices used in the Western market. Past statistics on crimes show that the more noticeable and better technology the camera systems are, the more it helps in preventing criminal activities in business or residential buildings 6 Factors that are necessary for an outdoor camera are: they should be weather- resistant, and should include night vision even in well-lit locations.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify. With rolling code technology minimizing any chance of a security breach, this is a strong indoor motion sensor helping you save money and detect any intruders in one hit.</p>
