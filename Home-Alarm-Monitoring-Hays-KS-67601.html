And Nest's monitoring plans start at $10 per month for a limited basic plan. If there is any movement in front of the house, the camera will record pictures and videos and send the same to the control room and the owner's phone.Those residents wanting more details of this app are requested to speak to the designated police officials in their respective police station limits.</p>

<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>

However, as a user, you have to subscribe to the professional monitoring service.</p>
