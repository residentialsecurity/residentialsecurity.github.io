<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. Ella can recognize hundreds of thousands of natural language queries, letting users search footage to find clips showing specific animals, people wearing clothes of a certain color, or even individual car makes and models. These Decoders are equipped with powerful capabilities and can manage a flexible display of IP cameras on LCD video walls. When a door or window is shut, the contact of the door or window in the frame is detected by door and window sensors.</p>
<p>Effective home security systems can guard your windows and doors, detect motion inside your home, and automatically contact dispatchers in the case of an emergency. These smart digital cameras can spot motion, detect objects, read vehicle number plates, and even identify human behaviors. Sound the siren on your Ring Alarm from anywhere inside your home and dispatch emergency services with professional monitoring.</p>

Eurovigil offers highly advanced and complete security systems, which include Video Door Phones, Intrusion Alarm Systems, Home Automation Systems, CCTV Surveillance, Access Control Systems and CMS (Central Monitoring Station).
