<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger.

Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
<p>By 2020, the country hopes to have 570 million speed cameras to help develop a database that will recognize any citizen within three seconds.

I'd certainly say it's one of the better cameras in terms of video quality.</p>
