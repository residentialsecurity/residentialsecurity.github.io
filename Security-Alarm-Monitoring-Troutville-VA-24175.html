Properly located video surveillance cameras can extend the range of the security staff and provide valuable incident information. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.</p>

Among the many advanced features of a wireless home surveillance system from Vivint, cloud storage is one of the key components that connect it all.
