<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Popular monitoring solutions include ADT, SimpliSafe, Ring, Nest, etc. When the magnetic connection is broken by opening a door or window that is protected, the alarm is triggered. I used a monitoring service from CardioNet for several years until my insurance decided they wouldn't cover it any more. The largest proportion, 65%, have a deadlocks on doors, 57% have outdoor security lighting and 45% a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>These types of cameras allow for discreet placement which means you can capture good footage of theft and criminal damage. Likewise with circuits from a burglar alarm that are designated as fire zones or circuits, these would be covered by Article 760.
