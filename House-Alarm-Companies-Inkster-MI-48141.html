<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app ‘EZVIZ' by the house owners. Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.
