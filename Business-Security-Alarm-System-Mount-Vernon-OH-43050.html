Most frequently it is used in video surveillance systems and can provide a storage of 2 TB to 4 TB.

There are three types of CCTV surveillance cameras on the market, from the most affordable entry level analogue cameras to High Definition (HD) and Internet Protocol (IP) cameras at the top end of the market.
