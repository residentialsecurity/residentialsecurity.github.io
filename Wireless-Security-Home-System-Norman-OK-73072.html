<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The main difference between the two is that the Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera has a more robust design and is built to be weatherproof, rain or shine. This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market. Among the various criteria that impact surveillance network video recorder (NVR) system value, storage capacity can be particularly significant and easily misunderstood.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike. Founded in 1999, Vivint has positioned itself as a next generation home security services provider with an emphasis on home automation and integration with smart home devices.</p>
