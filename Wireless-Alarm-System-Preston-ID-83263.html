This makes monitored alarms the safest bet when it comes to security, and means that burglar alarms always prove effective, no matter what.</p>
<p>In place of the source of illumination 87 and cell 88 or in combination therewith and the other devices, we may employ a bulb or source of light 92 in combinatlon with alight-sensitive cell 94 connected through a battery 89 with an amplifier vacuum tube 95. From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>

<p>The audible alarm device 6 is in parallel with the igniter 27 being connected by a wire 48 with one of the wires 31, at a. point between the-switch 35 and fuses 34. A similar wire 49 connects the other pole of the device 6 to a binding post on the insulating bar 30. The binding posts on the insulation 30 are shownfat 50, the wires 29 being at'- tached to two of these posts and the wires y31 to the same pair of posts; whilethe third post has secured to it the end of the wire 49. This third post also has attached a wire 51 which lisia continuation of the wire 49 and leads to one of a pair -offleaf-springs 52 in the casing' l. The other leaf-spring l52 is connected by a wire 53 to the proper binding ost so that the alarm device 6 is in effect ridged across the conductor-S31 and will erate whenever the switch 33 is closed and t e leaf-spring contacts 52 are bridged.</p>
