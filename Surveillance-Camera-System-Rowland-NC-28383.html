<p>Founded in 2004, Ohio AMS has been proudly serving Ohio's courts and corrections industry with high quality monitoring products and services for over a decade. Although entry and exit trigger times are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time in our tests was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded. Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>
<p>Driven by video analytics, CCTV cameras are able to zoom in to reveal the identity of an individual - intruder and guest - that is highly beneficial to prevent crimes when utilized properly. If you want to remotely record a security camera, you can try to set up the recording to an FTP server.
