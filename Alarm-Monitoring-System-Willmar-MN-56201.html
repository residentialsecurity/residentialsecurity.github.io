<p>At the same time, placing CCTV cameras within such locations not only cuts the risk of having someone physically watch over such dangerous areas, but also allow you to see the place in real-time. It is of note that some garage operators do not locate cameras in parking garages and lots due to the concern that doing so may expose the company to liability unless there is adequate staff to monitor the images.</p>
<p>These types of camera systems allow you to stream video to your smartphone, tablet or desktop computer; and will even send you notifications if they detect motion. While having the monitoring data from RPA's Passive House projects will be very useful, it will be even more valuable to aggregate the data from all PHIUS certified Passive House projects into a single repository so we can compare information across climate zones furthering the climate adaptive standards.</p>

DVRs capture footage from analog cameras in a digital format at the desired resolution and frames per second.</p>
<p>The batteries will last somewhere between 3-6 months, and it only takes about three hours to charge them back up. If you don't want to worry about battery life at all, Arlo also offers a compatible solar panel that can charge your cameras without taking them down to plug in. In addition to professional installation and monitoring, we perform annual inspections to make sure your business burglar alarm system is up to code and functioning properly.</p>
