<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. SimpliSafe has earned this spot with easy DIY setup, fast response times, and an impressive lineup of home automation features. With Vivint wireless security camera systems, there are no wires to alert intruders that they are being monitored, and the network signal will still transmit even if the power goes out. The associated technology is transitioning from standalone and analog video to networked (IP) and digital video.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>
