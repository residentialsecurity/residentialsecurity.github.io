<p>Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches. Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>
