EZVIZ cameras are equipped with Starlight Technology, allowing them to really shine in a wide range of situations and environments. With a mile-long list of device options, we think Nest Secure is one of the best smart home security systems around.

<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras. These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible.</p>
