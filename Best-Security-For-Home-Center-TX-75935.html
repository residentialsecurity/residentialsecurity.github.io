<p>This is sold as the Nest Secure alarm system, commanding a premium fee of $399, and it includes a base station, two Nest Tags, and two sensors. Commercial and government sectors would be key end users of CCTV cameras; residential sector to represent potential growth avenues.

<p>Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. Because of the home automation feature, you have the option to install the Frontpoint app and gain remote control over your security system, alarm history and visitor activity.</p>

We don't need sophisticated micro controllers like 8051 to build a very simple burglar alarm circuit with minimal features.</p>
<p>Video doorbells are the most popular security product owned (18.2%) with a professionally monitored home security system (16.2%) as 2nd most popular. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company.

<p>But ADT is known to offer deals that alleviate the cost of equipment, which makes the overall cost for a 36-month contract a lot more reasonable. Most of the top home security companies offer some form of smart home compatibility. Most security cameras use Wi-Fi, but not all rely on it exclusively.
