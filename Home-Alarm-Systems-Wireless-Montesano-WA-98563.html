<p>Our video security and information management solution helps you build security systems that will evolve alongside your changing needs. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a PTZ camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>

DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need themâ€”perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs. CCTV is different from broadcast television as all the equipment is directly connected together with cables or wireless transmitters that can not be received by standard television aerials or transmissions of the video signals are only intended to be accessible by the equipment on its dedicated closed circuit.</p>
<p>Other brands, like Ring and Nest Secure , offer a handful of cool smart devices. Evidence, however, has shown that video surveillance cameras have limited, if any, effects on crime prevention. 2.
