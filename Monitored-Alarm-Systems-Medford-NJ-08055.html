<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Though these surveillance cameras have relatively discrete appearance, it still has a great effect in deterring criminals. Most frequently it is used in video surveillance systems and can provide a storage of 2 TB to 4 TB. The system is also subject to false alarms resulting from automobile headlights, lightning flashes and so forth, entering the receiver. Our local reseller offers several levels of service, each of which offers different features, but with a similar up-front cost of about $300.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. There are plenty of affordable cameras available that offer good video performance, but as with just about any smart device, you'll pay more for features such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connectivity, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage options, and rechargeable battery power.</p>
