<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Nest Secure seamlessly integrates into Nest smart home ecosystems. CCTV cameras are available in various types depending on different characteristics. However, additional sensors and things such as cameras will increase the price, often significantly. Network cameras can be wireless and still work through a network and are used in big departmental stores, food chains, malls, factory, work shop, and many other public places to keep a check of the activities.</p>
<p>Compared to the Nest Cam cameras, it has a lower resolution at 720p. All the components of the system are interconnected using many cameras for critical sites, by means of IP mega pixel cameras.

<p>In addition to security, outdoor cameras provide extra accountability. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service.
