<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
<p>According to the market analysis, the residential segment is expected to grow at a CAGR 17.8% during the forecast period, which is the highest among all other end users of CCTV cameras. Driveway alarms can also be purchased in hard-wired and wireless systems. Another aspect of consideration is the development of energy-efficient devices for long-term monitoring and portable applications.</p>

<p>The magnet part goes on the door or window, while the switch part goes on the window frame or doorjamb. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). It doesn't work with many third-party smart-home devices, though, and it isn't very useful without a monitoring subscription.</p>
<p>The software segment of the video surveillance market is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Understand resolution: The higher the resolution number, the sharper the image will be. Entry level camera resolution is 330 lines, high resolution cameras producing better than 400 lines.
