<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
