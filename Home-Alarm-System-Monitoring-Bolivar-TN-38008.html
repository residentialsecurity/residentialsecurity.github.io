<p>Home automation features: Smart home automation features include HD video surveillance services, smoke and fire monitoring, smart door lock control, garage door control and smart lighting. In this direction, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (i.e. drones) are nowadays deployed in order to provide video surveillance versatility and functionalities that are hardly possible based on conventional fixed cameras.</p>
<p>The recording device receives and stores the images from the cctv camera, previously time lapsed VCR's and video multiplexers were generally used in CCTV systems, but due to developments in technology digital video recorders are now more commonly used. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>To learn if it is possible to skip the WiFi setup, it is best to contact the support team of your security camera brand. When your system is armed and any of these sensors are triggered, a signal is sent to the monitoring station-typically via your telephone line, although some alarm monitoring systems also offer alternate or backup transmission options.</p>

The young man who was the culprit fled and the police was stymied because the building had not set up any cameras in the basement, so there was no record of the crime to help the investigation.</p>
