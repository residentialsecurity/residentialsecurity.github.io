We then dove deeper into the home security experience, asking questions about satisfaction with cost, setup, reliability, and services, as well as satisfaction with various features of these systems such as motion detection and smartphone control.</p>
<p>The Wired Auto dialer is connected with wires to the main control unit whereas the Wireless Auto dialer does not use wired to connect to the Control unit.
