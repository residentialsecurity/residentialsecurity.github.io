<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. Additionally, many home security companies charge high cancellation fees if you terminate a monitoring agreement before you pay for your equipment in full. Video surveillance is an important application that utilizes shared storage resources.
