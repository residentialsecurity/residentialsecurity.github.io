<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Cable 24 serves as a shunt resistor in the sense that whenever current is drawn from or charged to the battery, a voltage is created across cable 24.

<p>Also mobile devices like tablets, smartphones and body-worn cameras can be connected safely to your video security system. A few cameras will even let you save video to a portable USB or NAS drive, but these devices are few and far between.

<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that captures video at 720p will usually offer a fairly sharp picture, but 1080p video offers more detail and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it doesn't require lots of storage capacity and can be viewed on nearly all phones, tablets, and PCs.</p>
<p>A regular video surveillance system provides the live views of the cameras, usually splitting large display to include various camera views, and these are supervised by a security team. At the heart of Frontpoint Security is the Frontpoint Hub, which serves as a central controller for all of your security devices. Our indoor and outdoor security cameras are in stock and available for direct shipping Monday through Friday.</p>
