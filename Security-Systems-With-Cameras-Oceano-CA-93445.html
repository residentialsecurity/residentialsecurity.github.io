<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A shift from analog to IP technologies, cloud solutions for storage, and rise of video surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) present new, untapped opportunities for security solution providers. The outdoor camera is waterproof, comes with night vision, has a 12x digital zoom to enhance any detail you need to focus on. Both can also be included in a Nest Aware package to record and store all video automatically to the cloud.</p>
<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
