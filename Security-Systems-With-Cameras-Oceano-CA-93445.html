<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms.

The outdoor camera is waterproof, comes with night vision, has a 12x digital zoom to enhance any detail you need to focus on.

To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
