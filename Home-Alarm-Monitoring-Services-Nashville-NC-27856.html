<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A shift from analog to IP technologies, cloud solutions for storage, and rise of video surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) present new, untapped opportunities for security solution providers.

<h3>Opposing Arguments to the Use of CCTV Security Camera Surveillance in Nashville NC 27856</h3>

<p>Driven by video analytics, CCTV cameras are able to zoom in to reveal the identity of an individual - intruder and guest - that is highly beneficial to prevent crimes when utilized properly.
