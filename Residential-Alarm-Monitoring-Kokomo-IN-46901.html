<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do. While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system.
