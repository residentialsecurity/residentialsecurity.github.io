If the battery is relatively stable, and the thresholds for discharge comparator 40 and charge comparator 42 are properly set, successful sensing of alarm conditions will occur, without activation by changes in battery voltage not due to unauthorized entry.

<p>Video doorbells offer an easy way to see who is at your door without having to open or even get close to the door.

Most outdoor security cameras have an IP66 rating, which means they offer complete protection from dust ingress and can handle water jets from any direction, but shouldn't be immersed in water.</p>
<p>As adjuncts to the system the treads of the stairs are sometimes arranged to ring the bell, by completing a circuit when trod on. Door mats are also arranged to close circuits in like manner. To make sure these are as discreet as possible, installation is normally carried out by an alarm company, however, some DIY options are available.
