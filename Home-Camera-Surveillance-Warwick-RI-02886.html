<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Most cameras also feature infrared night vision capable of surveillance in total darkness. The Monitoring Association (TMA) ensures quality and customer service excellence.

Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>
<p>7. In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting a beam across said opening, an optical system arranged to divide the light from said source into two beams, means for receiving said light beams and converting said beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, a light chopper arranged so that the output of said receiving means is constant and to vary the voltage of said energy when one of said beams is intercepted by an intruder and means responsive to the varying volt- 85 age for operating an alarm system.</p>

<p>In place of the source of illumination 87 and cell 88 or in combination therewith and the other devices, we may employ a bulb or source of light 92 in combinatlon with alight-sensitive cell 94 connected through a battery 89 with an amplifier vacuum tube 95. From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>
