<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. That's especially true if you've already sunk money into other Nest gear like the thermostat or cameras Instead of getting a separate security system, you can get one that syncs with your current equipment and uses the same app you're already used to. The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>Protect your homes and offices with security systems by Eurovigil, a brand by Eureka Forbes that has come a long way in giving its customers the most advanced technology in intruder alarms.

And while there are varying styles for these two types of security cameras, the differences will become more apparent once you compare their features, so there's no need to separate them further.
