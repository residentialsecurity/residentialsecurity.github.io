Addressing concerns about the over-reliance on cameras, Mr. Viswanathan says he does not see CCTVs as a solution to every problem.</p>

CCTV was initially developed as a means to increase security for banks but over time it has developed into a cost effective means of general video surveillance and home security.

<p>You can easily view your surveillance videos live and review past recorded footage on your PC, tablet or smartphone through our free phone app. With help of the handy Foscam app for iOS and Android, you can enjoy simple plug-and-play setup where you can remotely access your security camera feed, recordings, and motion events even when you're away from home.</p>
