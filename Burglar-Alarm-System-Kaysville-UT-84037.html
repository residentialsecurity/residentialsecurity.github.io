<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
<p>Compared to equipment offered by other home security providers, Protect America's may not be the most impressive, but their door and windows sensors, indoor and outdoor cameras and glass-break detectors are all sturdy and functional. Smart city projects have created a huge demand for the surveillance market.
