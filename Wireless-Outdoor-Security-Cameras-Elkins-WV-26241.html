<p>It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing. ADT now offers a full DIY home security system called Blue by ADT Blue by ADT is the result of ADT's acquisition and merger with LifeShield. Customizable home security packages are available with professional monitoring or self-monitoring.</p>
