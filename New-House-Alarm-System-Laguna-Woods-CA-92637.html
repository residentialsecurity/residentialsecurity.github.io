<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. As a partner with Nest, they also allow you to choose between using their own equipment or Nest Secure equipment and monitoring. In contrast, electronic monitoring equipment averages between $4 and $9 per day - a dramatic savings. Link Interactive offers customization on everything from the security equipment you pick to the length of your contract. In addition to providing more comprehensive protection, complete home security systems that are backed by professional monitoring services may also qualify customers for discounted homeowner's insurance premiums of up to 20 percent.</p>
<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
